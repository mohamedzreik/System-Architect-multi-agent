Understand the evolution from typed commands to graphical interfaces and why the command line remains relevant:

Back in the dim and distant past, people controlled computers with typed commands. Then the Graphical User Interface (GUI) evolved and pointing and clicking superseded typing. That's how most people work with computers today, though often they use a finger on a touchscreen rather than a mouse on a desk.

You can still control computers by entering commands on the keyboard and, as you'll have guessed, this takes place at the command line. Windows, macOS and Linux all provide facilities for presenting you with a command line. These applications typically go by the names consoles or terminals.

On macOS, for example, the app is Terminal. You'll find it in
Applications > Utilities
. Different versions of Linux offer different terminal apps, and they typically call them Terminal and make them accessible from the desktop. Windows 10 has Windows Terminal; older versions have a
Command Prompt
 entry in the
Start
 menu which calls up their terminal app. Microsoft also has
Windows Subsystem for Linux(link takes you to an external page)
, which implements a Linux command line in Windows 10.

A terminal is just a presentation mechanism; the software doing the real work goes by the name "shell". That's why you might see PowerShell in your terminal window on a Windows PC. The shell provides the real interface between you and the computer; the terminal just displays the shell's output in a window and sends your key presses to the shell.

If you've used a Linux computer that someone configured not to start up a desktop screen, you've used the command line all along and communicated directly with a shell. You generally use terminal apps only from a GUI's desktop.

Experienced developers have favorite shells, but at the start, it's best to make use of the one your operating system provides. Once you understand how it works, and have begun making use of it, you can start to explore the alternatives.

Info

Throughout this guide, you'll see the terms "command line", "terminal", "console", and "shell" used somewhat interchangeably. While they technically refer to different parts of the system, they all relate to controlling your computer with typed commands.

The shell's prompt

Positive FeedbackNegative Feedback

Learn what the prompt is and how it signals the shell is ready for your input:

However, when you invoke a shell, you'll see what's known as a "prompt", the shell's cue to you to type in a command. When the command completes, you'll see the prompt appear again: the shell tells you that it's ready for its next task.

Many different shells exist, so you may not always see the same prompt when you use multiple machines. The most common Linux shell,
Bash(link takes you to an external page)
, uses the
$
 symbol as its standard prompt. macOS recently began using
the Z Shell(link takes you to an external page)
, which uses
%
 as its prompt. On Windows, the prompt is usually a
>
. Whatever the symbol, and whatever information appears alongside it — often the current directory, but you might also see the drive letter, the name of the logged-in user, or the date — the prompt tells you the shell waits for input.

Current directory? This is another common term you'll read in discussions concerning the command line. You might also see people call it the "working directory". "Directory" is just shell-speak for the folder, "working" the one you're currently viewing in the terminal.

Files, directories, and their paths

files-directories-and-their-paths page anchor

Positive FeedbackNegative Feedback

Discover how to navigate your file system using absolute and relative paths:

The sequence of directories containing a file or directory makes up its "path". Here's a macOS example:

Copy code block

/Users/Twilio/GitHub/scripts/imageprep.sh

This is an "absolute" path: it identifies precisely where you can find the file
imageprep.sh
. Linux and macOS use the
/
symbol, as shown above, to separate files and directories in the path, but Windows uses
\
 so just replace one with the other in this and the following examples if you're using Windows Terminal or PowerShell.

Depending on your shell, you may be able to use "relative" paths. Paths that depend on where you're starting from. These use the following markers:

.
 — the current directory.

..
 — a parent directory.

So if you're working in the directory
/Users/Twilio/Documents/websource/
 then you can access the script — the
.sh
 file — mentioned above using the relative path:

Copy code block

../../GitHub/scripts/imageprep.sh

This means 'go up to the parent directory' (ie.
Documents/
), 'go up to the next parent directory' (
Twilio/
), then 'go down to
GitHub/scripts/imageprep.sh
'.

If you're wondering what the
/
 right at the start of the first path is, it's special: it's the Linux and macOS "root" directory. This is the top-most directory from which all other branches.

You may see a
~
 (tilde) in paths. It represents the current user's home directory, making it ideal for scripts used by different people.

To run the script
imageprep.sh
, you must provide its name at the prompt. If it's in a different directory from the one in which you're working, provide an absolute or relative path. If it's in the working directory, you can omit the path. However, you will need to tell the shell that the file is here: prefix it with
./
 to indicate the current directory:

Copy code block

./imageprep.sh

(information)

Info

It's outside of the scope of this guide, but it's useful to know that Linux and macOS shells have a variable called
$PATH
 that tells them where to look for files: it contains a list of directory paths. If you type just
imageprep.sh
, the shell will only look for the file in the directories included in
$PATH
. That's why you need the
./
 above —
/Users/Twilio/GitHub/scripts
 not listed in
$PATH
.

When referencing shell variables (though not when setting them), always prefix their names with the
$
 sign.

Useful commands

Explore essential commands for listing files, checking directories, and creating folders:

If you open up a terminal now, when the prompt appears enter one of the following commands:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| macOS/Linux |
ls
 |
| Windows Terminal |
DIR
 |

These commands tell the shell to list the files and sub-directories within the current directory, also known as the working directory. How can you see what that is? With another command of course:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| macOS/Linux |
pwd
 |
| Windows Terminal |
CHDIR
 |

To create a new directory, use the following command:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| macOS/Linux/Windows Terminal |
mkdir

DIRECTORY_PATH
 |

If the value you put in place of
DIRECTORY_PATH
 is just the new directory's name, the command creates it in the working directory.

To move or "change" to another directory, use the following commands:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| macOS/Linux |
cd

DIRECTORY_PATH
 |
| Windows Terminal |
CHDIR

DIRECTORY_PATH
 |

There are literally dozens of commands you can enter, far too many to list here. There are
lots of online resources
 that list them. Use your favorite search engine.

Arguments: Information for commands

arguments-information-for-commands page anchor

Positive FeedbackNegative Feedback

Learn how to provide additional information to commands using arguments, switches, and flags:

Most commands are more than a single word, you can provide extra information in the form of
"arguments"
 placed after the command and separated by at least one space. Arguments might include target filenames or the location of the directory where the command's results will be placed.

The need to separate arguments with spaces means you need to take care with file and directory names that contain spaces. The technique of telling a shell to treat included spaces as part of an argument and not a separator goes by the name "quoting". For example, to stop the second space in the command

Copy code block

cat /Users/Twilio/my file.txt

from causing errors (specifically
cat: /Users/Twilio/my: no such file or directory
 and
cat: file.txt: no such file or directory
), you wrap the argument in quotes:

Copy code block

cat "/Users/Twilio/my file.txt"

This correctly displays the contents of the named file.

Other arguments govern how the command works: these go by the names "switches", "flags" or "options" and have the prefix
-
 or
--
. For example, you might issue the
ls
 command mentioned above with these two switches:

Copy code block

ls -l -a

Respectively, these cause
ls
 to output its list in columns (
-l
) and to include hidden files (
-a
). The
ls
 command allows you to combine switches into a single statement:

Copy code block

ls -la

This has the same effect as the previous example but is more compact. Many commands work this way, but not all do. Many commands have the switches
-h
 and/or
--help
 which will cause them to output guidance — these will tell you if the command supports combining switches and flags this way.

Remember the
mkdir
 command you saw earlier? If you provide a full path as an argument and that includes directories that don't exist,
mkdir
 will display an error message. However, if you also include the
-p
 switch,
mkdir
 will also create any 'missing' directories within the path.

Shell scripts

Learn how to automate tasks by combining commands with variables and logic:

The shell includes some commands, but many more run as standalone programs. Others are
"shell scripts"
. Scripts make the command line attractive to developers because they combine multiple commands with variables and flow logic to automate key tasks.

For example, you might write a script to send SMS messages through the Twilio API. The script prompts for a phone number and message, confirms before sending, calls the API using
curl
, and parses the response to show success or failure.

Shell scripting opens up endless possibilities: extracting data points from log files, packaging apps for distribution, automating deployment processes, or interacting with any API. Scripts make these tasks repeatable, reliable, and fast.

The shell reads and handles most lines in a script as if you'd keyed them in at the prompt. Lines beginning with
#
 are comments — shells ignore any text after that symbol, up to the end of the line. The first line,
#!/bin/bash
, is special: it tells the operating system which program to use to run the script.

The script starts by defining three variables for your Twilio credentials. You need to replace the placeholder values (
YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID
,
YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
, and
YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
) with your actual credentials from the Twilio Console. Not including spaces on either side of the assignment operator,
=
, is a requirement in shell scripting.

The
echo
 command prints text to the terminal, and
read
 waits for you to type something and press Enter, storing what you typed in a variable. The script uses these commands to gather the recipient's phone number and message text.

Before sending, the script displays what you entered and asks for confirmation. The
if
 statement checks whether you entered
y
 to confirm. If you didn't, the script exits with an exit code of 0 (success) without sending anything.

To actually send the SMS, the script uses
curl
, a command-line tool for making HTTP requests. The
-s
 flag makes
curl
 run silently (no progress bar),
-X POST
 specifies the HTTP method, and
-u
 provides authentication credentials. The
--data-urlencode
 flag safely formats each piece of data for the API. The
$VARIABLE
 syntax reads the value of a variable you've defined.

The
$(...)
 formatting tells the shell to run the code in the brackets and store whatever that code outputs in a variable. Here, you capture the entire API response in
RESPONSE
, then use
grep
 and
cut
 to extract just the message SID. This is a unique identifier Twilio assigns to each message.

Finally, the script checks if it successfully extracted a message SID. The
-n
 flag in the
if
 statement returns true if the variable contains any text. If the SID exists, you know the message was sent successfully.

To use this script, save it as
send-sms.sh
, then make it executable:

Copy code block

chmod +x send-sms.sh

Run it by entering
./send-sms.sh
 at the prompt.
