Twilio API overview

The Twilio
APIs
 are organized around
REST
. Behind these APIs is a software layer connecting and optimizing communications networks around the world. With the Twilio APIs, you can build applications that help your users send messages, make phone calls, look up phone numbers, and more.
In Twilio's ecosystem, each product corresponds to an API. For example, Twilio Messaging corresponds to the Messaging API. Although each API has its own unique features, they all share a common set of principles and practices. This consistency allows you to work with different Twilio APIs in a similar way. You can use the APIs directly over HTTPS or through
Twilio SDKs
 available for several programming languages.
