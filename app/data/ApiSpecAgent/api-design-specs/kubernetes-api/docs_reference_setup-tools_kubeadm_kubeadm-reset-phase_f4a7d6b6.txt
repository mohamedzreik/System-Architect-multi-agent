kubeadm reset phase

kubeadm reset phase
 enables you to invoke atomic steps of the node reset process.
Hence, you can let kubeadm do some of the work and you can fill in the gaps
if you wish to apply customization.

kubeadm reset phase
 is consistent with the
kubeadm reset workflow
,
and behind the scene both use the same code.

 to revert any changes made to this host by
kubeadm init
 or
