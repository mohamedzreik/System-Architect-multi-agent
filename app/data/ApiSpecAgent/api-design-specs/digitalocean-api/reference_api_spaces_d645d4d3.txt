Spaces API Reference Documentation

Validated on 21 Aug 2025 • Last edited on 23 Oct 2025

Spaces exposes an S3-compatible RESTful XML API over HTTP. You can access the Spaces API in two ways:

S3-compatible tools
: Set the endpoint to
${REGION}.digitaloceanspaces.com
 and use a Spaces key pair. See
Using DigitalOcean Spaces with AWS SDKs
.

Direct API calls
: Sign requests with an
Authorization
 header, add common headers, and call bucket or object operations.

The API accepts standard HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests. The API returns HTTP/2 responses when supported by the client and otherwise returns HTTP/1.1 responses. Some HTTP/2 requests are downgraded to HTTP/1.1 for operational reasons, as permitted by the HTTP/2 specification.

Authentication

Requests to the Spaces API must include an HTTP
Authorization
 header. Spaces supports
AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4)
 (recommended) and
Signature Version 2 (SigV2)
 for legacy clients. Throughout the examples below, SigV4 is used. When using a client library, signatures are generated automatically.

To authenticate manually,
create a Spaces access key and secret
.

A SigV4 signature consists of several parts. The table below describes each component:

| Signature component | Description |
| --- | --- |
|
AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
 | Indicates AWS Signature Version 4 (AWS4) and the signing algorithm (HMAC-SHA256). |
|
Credential
 | Contains your access key and request information in the format:
${ACCESS_KEY}/${YYYYMMDD}/${REGION_SLUG}/s3/aws4_request
. |
|
SignedHeaders
 | A lower-cased list of the request headers used when computing the signature. For example,
host;x-amz-acl;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date
. |
|
Signature
 | A signed hash consisting of a hash of the request body, your secret key, and request information (the canonical request). |

The canonical request included in the signature is made up of:

The HTTP request method used.

The path component of the request URI.

The query string parameters included in the request.

The list of request headers and their values, newline separated, lower-cased, and trimmed of whitespace.

The list of header names without their values, sorted alphabetically, lower-cased, and semicolon-separated.

The SHA256 hash of the request body.

Example Canonical Request

Start with the original, unsigned HTTP request:

GET /?acl HTTP/1.1
Host: static-images.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
x-amz-content-sha256: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
x-amz-date: 20170804T221549Z

Convert that into the canonical request (method, path, canonical headers, signed headers list, and payload hash):

GET
/
acl=
host:static-images.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
x-amz-content-sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
x-amz-date:20170804T221549Z

host;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date
e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855

Example Authorization Header

After computing the signature, the client sends an
Authorization
 header like this:

Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
Credential=II5JDQBAN3JYM4DNEB6C/20170710/nyc3/s3/aws4_request,
SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date,
Signature=6cab03bef74a80a0441ab7fd33c829a2cdb46bba07e82da518cdb78ac238fda5

Signing Example (pseudo-code)

The following pseudo-code shows how to build the string to sign and compute the SigV4 signature:

canonicalRequest = `
${HTTPMethod}\n
${canonicalURI}\n
${canonicalQueryString}\n
${canonicalHeaders}\n
${signedHeaders}\n
${hashedPayload}
`

stringToSign = "AWS4-HMAC-SHA256" + "\n" +
 date(format=ISO8601) + "\n" +
 date(format=YYYYMMDD) + "/" + ${REGION} + "/" + "s3/aws4_request" + "\n" +
 Hex(SHA256Hash(canonicalRequest))

dateKey = HMAC-SHA256("AWS4" + ${SECRET_KEY}, date(format=YYYYMMDD))
dateRegionKey = HMAC-SHA256(dateKey, ${REGION})
dateRegionServiceKey = HMAC-SHA256(dateRegionKey, "s3")
signingKey = HMAC-SHA256(dateRegionServiceKey, "aws4_request")

signature = Hex(HMAC-SHA256(signingKey, stringToSign))

Common Headers

PUT
 requests with an XML body. |
|
Content-Type
 | MIME type of the request body, for example
text/plain
. |
