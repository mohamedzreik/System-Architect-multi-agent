DigitalOcean OAuth API

Validated on 18 Aug 2025 • Last edited on 28 Aug 2025

OAuth 2.0
 is an open standard for authorization that enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to a service. The DigitalOcean OAuth API lets you obtain limited access to DigitalOcean teams by delegating authentication to DigitalOcean.

About the DigitalOcean OAuth API

Our OAuth API supports the
authorization code flow
 meant for web applications running on a server. It also supports the
implicit authorization flow
. This is useful for client-side applications such as mobile or desktop clients where the client secret should not be stored on the user's device.

The DigitalOcean authorization server,
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth
, has the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
|
/authorize
 | Request user authorization |
|
/token
 | Request an authorized access token |
|
/refresh
 | Refresh an access token using a refresh token |
|
/revoke
 | Revoke an access token |

To use the OAuth API, first
register your application
 to use OAuth. Registering an application assigns it a client ID and client secret which you then use in API calls to the DigitalOcean authorization server.

For issues and errors, use
the OAuth API troubleshooting guide
.

/authorize
: Request User Authorization

Use the
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/authorize
 endpoint as an authorization link to send to a user for your registered OAuth application.

Example

You can view an example link for a registered OAuth application in the control panel. On the
OAuth Applications
 page
, click the
…
 next to the application's name, then click
View
 to open the
Oauth Application Details
 window. In this window, the
Link to authorization code
 section has an example link.

Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Necessity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|
client_id
 | string | Required | The client ID for your registered OAuth application on DigitalOcean. |
|
redirect_uri
 | string | Required | The callback URL where users are sent after authorization. Must match the callback URL you provided during application registration. |
|
response_type
 | string | Required | Set to
code
 to request an authorization code. Set to
token
 to request an OAuth token for implicit authorization. |
|
scope
 | string | Optional | See
all token scopes
. |
|
state
 | string | Optional | An unguessable random string. Used to protect against request forgery attacks. Recommended. |
|
prompt
 | string | Optional | A space-separated list of strings that Defines the behavior of the authorization page as shown to the user when they authorize an OAuth application. See values below. |

The
response_type
 parameter can have the following values:

code
: Requests an authorization code. Used for the authorization code flow for web applications.

When you use this response type, you request the access token grant with the
/token
 endpoint.

token
: Requests an OAuth token. Used for the implicit authorization flow for client-side applications.

When you use this response type, you receive the access token grant in a callback.

The
prompt
 parameter can have the following values:

select_account
 (default):

If a user is not signed in, they are required to sign in.

Signed-in users must authorize the OAuth application before proceeding.

none
:

Signed-in users who have already authorized the application are redirected back to the valid
redirect_url
 with a new token. A hint can be used by specifying an i query parameter with the first 6 characters of an expected account UUID.

Signed-in users who haven't authorized the application are redirected with
error=consent_required
. Signed-out users are redirected with
error=login_required
.

Returns

If the user authorizes the application, DigitalOcean redirects back to your
redirect_uri
 with the following parameters:

One of the following, depending on the specified
response_type
:

The
code
 parameter with an authorization code. Use this in access token requests to
the
/token
 endpoint
.

The
token
 parameter with an OAuth token. Here is an example callback (access token grant) for
token
 response types:

https://example.com/callback#access_token=doo_v1_EXAMPLE4ea...381
 &token_type=bearer
 &expires_in=2592000
 &state=0807edf7d85e5d

The
state
 parameter, if you specified one in the authorization request.

Verify that the value of
state
 in the response matches the one you provided in the request. If not, it indicates that the request may be a forgery attack created by a third party, and you should abort the request.

The
expires_in
 parameter, which indicates the time remaining before the token expires in seconds.

The token is available to use to make requests via
the DigitalOcean API
 until the token expires (30 days after being issues) or is otherwise invalidated (for example, revoked or refreshed).

POST
/token
: Request Authorized Access Token

If a user authorizes your application with the authorization code flow, make a POST request to the
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/token
 endpoint with the appropriate parameters to request the access token.

Example

Here is an example access token request using
curl
:

curl -X POST "https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/token?grant_type=authorization_code
 &code=f252c4bd6b1b4d249b7
 &client_id=4c413ac36ac22268
 &client_secret=b05a2ad77b24f3
 &redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback"

Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Necessity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|
grant_type
 | string | Required | Must be set to
authorization_code
 for an access token request. |
|
code
 | string | Required | The code received as a response to authorization with the
/authorize
 endpoint. |
|
client_id
 | string | Required | The client ID for your registered OAuth application on DigitalOcean. |
|
client_secret
 | string | Required | The client secret for your registered OAuth application on DigitalOcean. |
|
redirect_uri
 | string | Required | Must match the callback URL that you supplied during application registration. |

Response

If the request was successful, the authorization server returns a JSON access token grant similar to the following:

{
 "access_token": "doo_v1_EXAMPLE4efe8999d0892b6069bc754a78c656f8e843361e1e4d1cd04ac85c381",
 "token_type": "bearer",
 "expires_in": 2592000,
 "refresh_token": "dor_v1_EXAMPLE3104521c47be0b580e9296453ef4y319b02b5513469f0ec72d99af2e2",
 "info": {
 "name": "Sammy the Shark",
 "email":"[email protected]",
 "uuid":"EXAMPLE0-a636-11ec-9e9d-3381ceabe039",
 "team_uuid": "EXAMPLE1-a636-11ec-a6ac-1323bf96ef4d",
 "team_name": "My Team"
 }
}

In addition to other information, the response includes two important items:
access_token
 and
refresh_token
.

The access token is available to use to make requests via
the DigitalOcean API
 until the token expires or token is otherwise invalidated.

POST
/refresh
: Refresh Token

Each access token comes with a refresh token. You can use a refresh token exactly once to create a new access token (and refresh token). Doing so invalidates the access token that the refresh token was issued with. A common use case is refreshing an expired token.

To refresh a token, make a POST request to the
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/refresh
 endpoint with the appropriate parameters.

Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Necessity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|
grant_type
 | string | Required | Must be set to
refresh_token
 for a token refresh request. |
|
refresh_token
 | string | Required | The
refresh_token
 that was received with the original access token. |

Response

The refresh token response is in the same format as the original access token grant. See
the response for
/token
.

POST
/revoke
: Revoke Token Flow

Revoking an access token invalidates it so that it cannot be used.

To revoke an access token, send a POST request to the
https://cloud/digitalocean.com/v1/oauth/revoke
 endpoint with an
Authorization: Bearer
 header and the appropriate parameters.

Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Necessity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|
token
 | string | Required | Must be set to the value of the access token. |

Response

The response to this request is an empty JSON object.
