My Account

Limited Early Access

The My Account API is available in Limited Early Access. To request access, contact your Auth0 account manager. To learn more about Auth0's product release cycle, read
Product Release Stages
.

The Auth0 My Account API provides a dedicated set of endpoints for users to manage their own account information. Customers can use these APIs to build self-service experiences in their applications or progressively add details to a user account.

The My Account API operates within the context of the currently logged-in user and can be used directly within user-facing applications.

Using Auth0 domain vs. custom domain

The My Account API supports using your canonical Auth0 domain or your custom domain, but you must use the same one throughout the entire process, including:

Getting an access token

Setting the audience value

Calling the My Account API endpoint

Custom Domains
.

Activate the My Account API
​

You can activate the My Account API for your tenant in the Auth0 Dashboard:

Navigate to Authentication > APIs.

Locate the MyAccount API banner.

Select Activate.

By default, the My Account API is created with the following application API access policies:

require_client_grant
 for user flows

deny_all
 for client (machine-to-machine) flows

For an application to access the My Account API on the user's behalf, you must explicitly create a client grant for that application, which allows you to define the maximum scopes the application can request. Alternatively, you can change the policy for user access flows to allow_all, which allows any application in your tenant to request any scope from the My Account API.

Because the My Account API exposes sensitive information and operations, Auth0 does not recommend using allow_all for user access flows. You should follow a least privilege principle with the My Account API to ensure applications only get access to what they truly need, minimizing potential security risks.

The final permissions granted to the application will be determined by the intersection of the scopes allowed by the application API access policy, the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions assigned to the end user, and any user consent given (if applicable).

Supported flows

You cannot update the application API policy for client access to the My Account API, which means you cannot access the My Account API using the Client Credentials Flow.

To learn more about how to manage application API access policies and their associated client grants, read
Application Access to APIs: Client Grants
.

Get an access token
​

You can get an access token for the My Account API in the same way you'd get an access token for one of your own APIs.

&nbsp

If you're going to allow the My Account API to perform sensitive operations (such as enrolling an authentication method), we strongly recommend that you use
step-up authentication
 to enforce additional security policies through
multi-factor authentication (MFA)
.

Examples
​

Universal Login with authorization code flow
​

Step 1: Request authorization code

curl --request GET \
 --url 'https://{yourDomain}/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={yourClientId}&redirect_uri=%7ByourRedirectUri%7D&scope=create%3Ame%3Aauthentication_methods&offline_access=&audience=https%3A%2F%2F{yourDomain}%2Fme%2F'

Step 2: Exchange code for access token

curl --request POST \
 --url 'https://{yourDomain}/oauth/token' \
 --header 'content-type: application/json' \
 --data '{"grant_type": "authorization_code","client_id": "{yourClientId}","client_secret": "{yourClientId}","code": "{yourAuthorizationCode}","redirect_uri": "{yourRedirectUri}","audience": "{yourAudience}","scope": "create:me:authentication_methods","offline_access": ""}'

Embedded login with native passkeys
​

Step 1: Request login challenge

curl --request POST \
 --url 'https://{yourDomain}/passkey/challenge' \
 --header 'content-type: application/json' \
 --data '{"client_id": "{yourDomain}"}'

Step 2: Authenticate existing user

curl --request POST \
 --url 'https://{yourDomain}/oauth/token' \
 --header 'content-type: application/json' \
 --data '{ "grant_type": "urn:okta:params:oauth:grant-type:webauthn", "client_id": "{yourClientId}", "scope": "create:me:authentication_methods offline_access", "audience": "https://{yourDomain}/me/" "auth_session": "{sessionIdFromTheFirstRequest}", "authn_response": "{authenticatorResponse}"}'

Rate limits
