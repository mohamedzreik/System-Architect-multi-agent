Get a commit

Returns the contents of a single commit reference. You must have
read
 access for the repository to use this endpoint.

Note

If there are more than 300 files in the commit diff and the default JSON media type is requested, the response will include pagination link headers for the remaining files, up to a limit of 3000 files. Each page contains the static commit information, and the only changes are to the file listing.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "
Media types
." Pagination query parameters are not supported for these media types.

application/vnd.github.diff
: Returns the diff of the commit. Larger diffs may time out and return a 5xx status code.

application/vnd.github.patch
: Returns the patch of the commit. Diffs with binary data will have no
patch
 property. Larger diffs may time out and return a 5xx status code.

application/vnd.github.sha
: Returns the commit's SHA-1 hash. You can use this endpoint to check if a remote reference's SHA-1 hash is the same as your local reference's SHA-1 hash by providing the local SHA-1 reference as the ETag.

Signature verification object

The response will include a
verification
 object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the
verification
 object:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|
verified
 |
boolean
 | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
|
reason
 |
string
 | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
|
signature
 |
string
 | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
|
payload
 |
string
 | The value that was signed. |
|
verified_at
 |
string
 | The date the signature was verified by GitHub. |

These are the possible values for
reason
 in the
verification
 object:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
|
expired_key
 | The key that made the signature is expired. |
|
not_signing_key
 | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
|
gpgverify_error
 | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
|
gpgverify_unavailable
 | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
|
unsigned
 | The object does not include a signature. |
|
unknown_signature_type
 | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
|
no_user
 | No user was associated with the
committer
 email address in the commit. |
|
unverified_email
 | The
committer
 email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
|
bad_email
 | The
committer
 email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
|
unknown_key
 | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
|
malformed_signature
 | There was an error parsing the signature. |
|
invalid
 | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |

Compare two commits

Compares two commits against one another. You can compare refs (branches or tags) and commit SHAs in the same repository, or you can compare refs and commit SHAs that exist in different repositories within the same repository network, including fork branches. For more information about how to view a repository's network, see "
Understanding connections between repositories
."

This endpoint is equivalent to running the
git log BASE..HEAD
 command, but it returns commits in a different order. The
git log BASE..HEAD
 command returns commits in reverse chronological order, whereas the API returns commits in chronological order.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "
Media types
."

application/vnd.github.diff
: Returns the diff of the commit.

application/vnd.github.patch
: Returns the patch of the commit. Diffs with binary data will have no
patch
 property.

The API response includes details about the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a
renamed
 status have a
previous_filename
 field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a
modified
 status have a
patch
 field showing the changes made to the file.

When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (
per_page
 or
page
), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison.

Working with large comparisons

To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query parameter (
per_page
 or
page
) to paginate the results. When using pagination:

The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, and it includes up to 300 changed files for the entire comparison.

The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.

For more information on working with pagination, see "
Using pagination in the REST API
."

Signature verification object

The response will include a
