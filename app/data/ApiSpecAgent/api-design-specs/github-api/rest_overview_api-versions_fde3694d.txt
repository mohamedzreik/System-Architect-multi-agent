About API versioning

The GitHub REST API is versioned. The API version name is based on the date when the API version was released. For example, the API version
2022-11-28
 was released on Mon, 28 Nov 2022.

Breaking changes are changes that can potentially break an integration. We will provide advance notice before releasing breaking changes. Breaking changes include:

Removing an entire operation

Removing or renaming a parameter

Removing or renaming a response field

Adding a new required parameter

Making a previously optional parameter required

Changing the type of a parameter or response field

Removing enum values

Adding a new validation rule to an existing parameter

Changing authentication or authorization requirements

Any additive (non-breaking) changes will be available in all supported API versions. Additive changes are changes that should not break an integration. Additive changes include:

Adding an operation

Adding an optional parameter

Adding an optional request header

Adding a response field

Adding a response header

Adding enum values

When a new REST API version is released, the previous API version will be supported for at least 24 more months following the release of the new API version.

Specifying an API version

You should use the
X-GitHub-Api-Version
 header to specify an API version. For example:

curl --header "X-GitHub-Api-Version:2022-11-28" https://api.github.com/zen

Requests without the
X-GitHub-Api-Version
 header will default to use the
2022-11-28
 version.

If you specify an API version that is no longer supported, you will receive a
400
 error.

Upgrading to a new API version

Before upgrading to a new REST API version, you should read the changelog of breaking changes for the new API version to understand what breaking changes are included and to learn more about how to upgrade to that specific API version. For more information, see
Breaking changes
.

When you update your integration to specify the new API version in the
X-GitHub-Api-Version
 header, you'll also need to make any changes required for your integration to work with the new API version.

Once your integration is updated, test your integration to verify that it works with the new API version.

Supported API versions

The following REST API versions are currently supported:

2022-11-28

You can also make an API request to get all of the supported API versions. For more information, see
