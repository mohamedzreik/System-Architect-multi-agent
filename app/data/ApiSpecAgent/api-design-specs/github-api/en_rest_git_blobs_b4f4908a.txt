REST API endpoints for Git blobs

Use the REST API to interact with a Git blob (binary large object), the object type used to store the contents of each file in a repository.

About Git blobs

A Git blob (binary large object) is the object type used to store the contents of each file in a repository. The file's SHA-1 hash is computed and stored in the blob object. These endpoints allow you to read and write
blob objects

to your Git database on GitHub. Blobs leverage
these custom media types
. For more information about the use of media types in the API, see
Getting started with the REST API
.
