REST API endpoints for rate limits

Use the REST API to check your current rate limit status.

About rate limits

You can check your current rate limit status at any time. For more information about rate limit rules, see
Rate limits for the REST API
.

The REST API for searching items has a custom rate limit that is separate from the rate limit governing the other REST API endpoints. For more information, see
REST API endpoints for search
. The GraphQL API also has a custom rate limit that is separate from and calculated differently than rate limits in the REST API. For more information, see
Rate limits and query limits for the GraphQL API
. For these reasons, the API response categorizes your rate limit. Under
resources
, you'll see objects relating to different categories:

The
core
 object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.

The
search
 object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching (excluding code searches). For more information, see
REST API endpoints for search
.

The
code_search
 object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching code. For more information, see
REST API endpoints for search
.

The
graphql
 object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL API.

The
integration_manifest
 object provides your rate limit status for the
POST /app-manifests/{code}/conversions
 operation. For more information, see
Registering a GitHub App from a manifest
.

The
dependency_snapshots
 object provides your rate limit status for submitting snapshots to the dependency graph. For more information, see
REST API endpoints for the dependency graph
.

The
code_scanning_upload
 object provides your rate limit status for uploading SARIF results to code scanning. For more information, see
Uploading a SARIF file to GitHub
.

The
actions_runner_registration
 object provides your rate limit status for registering self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions. For more information, see
REST API endpoints for self-hosted runners
.

For more information on the headers and values in the rate limit response, see
Rate limits for the REST API
.

Get rate limit status for the authenticated user

Note

Accessing this endpoint does not count against your REST API rate limit.

Some categories of endpoints have custom rate limits that are separate from the rate limit governing the other REST API endpoints. For this reason, the API response categorizes your rate limit. Under
resources
, you'll see objects relating to different categories:

The
core
 object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.

The
search
 object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching (excluding code searches). For more information, see "
Search
."

The
code_search
 object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching code. For more information, see "
Search code
."

The
graphql
 object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL API. For more information, see "
Resource limitations
."

The
integration_manifest
 object provides your rate limit status for the
POST /app-manifests/{code}/conversions
 operation. For more information, see "
Creating a GitHub App from a manifest
."

The
dependency_snapshots
 object provides your rate limit status for submitting snapshots to the dependency graph. For more information, see "
Dependency graph
."

The
dependency_sbom
 object provides your rate limit status for requesting SBOMs from the dependency graph. For more information, see "
Dependency graph
."

The
code_scanning_upload
 object provides your rate limit status for uploading SARIF results to code scanning. For more information, see "
Uploading a SARIF file to GitHub
."

The
actions_runner_registration
 object provides your rate limit status for registering self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions. For more information, see "
Self-hosted runners
."

The
source_import
 object is no longer in use for any API endpoints, and it will be removed in the next API version. For more information about API versions, see "
API Versions
."

Note

The
rate
 object is closing down. If you're writing new API client code or updating existing code, you should use the
core
 object instead of the
rate
 object. The
core
 object contains the same information that is present in the
rate
 object.
