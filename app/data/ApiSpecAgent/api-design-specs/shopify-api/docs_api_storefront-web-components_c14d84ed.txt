How Storefront Web Components work

Storefront Web Components are a set of HTML components that handle the complexity of querying Shopify's Storefront API, letting you display products, collections, and shopping cart functionality on your website without having to write complex JavaScript code.

After you add the
<shopify-store>
 and
<shopify-context>
 components to your markup and configure their attributes, you can access your store's data and then style it using CSS or HTML to create tailored shopping experiences.

Storefront Web Components are built for a wide range of use cases, from embedding your products and collections within existing content to building new pages for your site.
