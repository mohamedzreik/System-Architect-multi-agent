Authentication

To make full use of Hydrogen, you need to authenticate with and make requests to the
Storefront API
 and the
Customer Account API
. Hydrogen includes full-featured API clients to securely handle API queries and mutations.

You can create access tokens for your own Shopify store by
installing the Hydrogen sales channel
, which includes built-in support for Oxygen, Shopify's global edge hosting platform. Or install the
Headless sales channel
 to host your Hydrogen app anywhere.

Both the Storefront API and Customer Account API offer public credentials for client-side applications.

Anchor to How Hydrogen works with Hydrogen React
How Hydrogen works with Hydrogen React

Hydrogen is
built on React Router
. But many of the components, hooks and utilities built into Hydrogen come from
Hydrogen React
, an underlying package that's framework-agnostic. For convenience, the Hydrogen package re-exports those resources. This means that if you're building a Hydrogen app, then you should import modules from the
@shopify/hydrogen
 package.
