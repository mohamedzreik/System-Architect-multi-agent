Shopify offers a GitHub app to connect your Shopify and GitHub accounts. Use it when developing
themes
 and
Hydrogen storefronts
.

Anchor to Connect Shopify and GitHub
Connect Shopify and GitHub

Install the
Shopify GitHub app
 to connect your accounts.

Your Shopify account can only be connected to one GitHub account, which is why we recommend using
organization accounts
, which enable more flexible access control.

Organization accounts

We recommend using
GitHub organizations
 if possible. Organizations work with multiple individual GitHub accounts, enabling easier collaboration for teams, and more secure access control for GitHub repositories and Shopify stores.

Organization accounts are particularly helpful if you need to
transfer repository ownership
, which is common for agencies and freelance developers.

Anchor to Personal accounts
Personal accounts

You can connect your personal GitHub account to Shopify, but you can only have one Shopify account connected to one personal GitHub account at a time. That's why we recommend using
organization accounts
 if possible.

You can convert a
personal GitHub account to an organization
.

Anchor to Required GitHub permissions
Required GitHub permissions

For security reasons, we recommend granting access permission on a per-repository basis, instead of granting them for all repositories in your account or organization.

Disconnect Shopify and GitHub

You can disconnect your Shopify and GitHub accounts in your GitHub settings:

Open your
GitHub settings for app authorizations

Beside the Shopify app, click

.

Check the GitHub docs for more details on
deleting GitHub apps

Anchor to Troubleshooting and known limitations
Troubleshooting and known limitations

If you're connecting a new dev or client transfer store, then you can't set up the GitHub app on the initial login after the store is created. Log out of your store and log in again before proceeding.

If you access GitHub with SAML/SSO, you need an active SAML session to use the Shopify GitHub app. You can create a new SAML session by going to
https://github.com/orgs/{YOUR_ORGANIZATION}/sso
.

If your GitHub organization enables SAML/SSO and you already had the Shopify GitHub app installed, then you'll need to
re-authorize all your GitHub apps
, including the Shopify app.

The Shopify GitHub app doesn't support the
IP allow list
 feature of GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

If you
convert your user account to an organization
, then you'll need to uninstall and reinstall the Shopify GitHub app.

When connecting a repository, if you don't see the one you want to connect in the list of available repositories, then the GitHub organization owner will need to
update the repository access settings
 for the Shopify GitHub app.
