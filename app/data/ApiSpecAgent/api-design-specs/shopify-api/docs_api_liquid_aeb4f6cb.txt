What is a template language?

A template language allows you to create a single template to host static content, and dynamically insert information depending on where the template is rendered. For example, you can create a product template that hosts all of your standard product attributes, such as the product image, title, and price. That template can then dynamically render those attributes with the appropriate content, depending on the current product being viewed.

Anchor to Liquid basics
Liquid basics

Liquid is used to dynamically output objects and their properties. You can further modify that output by creating logic with tags, or directly altering it with a filter. Objects and object properties are output using one of six basic data types. Liquid also includes basic logical and comparison operators for use with tags.

Anchor to Defining logic with tags
Defining logic with tags

Liquid tags are used to define logic that tells templates what to do.

Tags are wrapped with curly brace percentage delimiters
{% %}
.
The text within the delimiters is an instruction, not content to render.

In the example to the right, the
if
 tag defines the condition to be met.
If
product.available
 returns
true
, then the price is displayed.
Otherwise, the "sold out" message is shown.

{% %}

To nest multiple tags inside one set of delimiters, use the
liquid
 tag.

Anchor to Tags with parameters
Tags with parameters

Some tags accept parameters: either required or optional.
For example, the
for
 tag takes an optional
limit
 parameter to stop the loop at a specific index.

Anchor to Modifying output with filters
Modifying output with filters

Liquid filters modify the output of variables and objects.

To filter the output of a tag, use the pipe character
|
, followed by the filter.
In this example,
product
 is the object,
title
 is its property, and
upcase
 is the filter.

Anchor to Filters with parameters
Filters with parameters

Many filters accept parameters that adjust their output.
Some parameters are required, others are optional.

Anchor to Using multiple filters
Using multiple filters

Multiple filters can be used on one output. They're applied from left to right.

Anchor to Referencing objects
Referencing objects

Liquid objects represent variables that you can use to build your theme. Object types include, but aren't limited to:

Store resources, such as a collection or product and its properties

Standard content that is used to power Shopify themes, such as
content_for_header

Functional elements that can be used to build interactivity, such as
paginate
 and
search

Objects might represent a single data point, or contain multiple properties. Some products might represent a related object, such as a product in a collection.

{{ }}

Double curly brace delimiters denote an output.

Anchor to Usage
Usage

To output an object, wrap it in curly brace delimiters
{{ }}
.

To output an object's property, use dot notation.
This example outputs the
product
 object's
title
 property.

Anchor to Object access
Object access

Objects can be accessed in three ways:

Globally
: Available in any Liquid file, excluding
checkout.liquid
 and
Liquid asset files

In templates
: Available in specific templates and their sections or blocks. For example, the
product
 object in a
product template

Through parent objects
: Returned as properties of other objects. For example,
article
 objects through
articles
 or
blog

Check each object's documentation to see how it can be accessed.

Anchor to Creating variables
Creating variables

To create your own variables, use variable tags like
assign
 or
capture
.
Syntactically, Liquid treats variables the same as objects.
