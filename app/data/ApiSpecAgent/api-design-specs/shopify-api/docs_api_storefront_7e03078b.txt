Anchor to Authentication
Authentication

The Storefront API supports both tokenless access and token-based authentication.

Anchor to Tokenless access
Tokenless access

Tokenless access allows API queries without an access token providing access to essential features such as:

Products and Collections

Selling Plans

Search

Pages, Blogs, and Articles

Cart (read/write)

Tokenless access has a query complexity limit of 1,000. Query complexity is calculated based on the cost of each field in the query. For more information, see the
Cost calculation
 section.

Anchor to Token-based authentication
Token-based authentication

For access to all Storefront API features, an access token is required. The following features require token-based authentication:

Product Tags

Metaobjects and Metafields

Menu (Online Store navigation)

Customers

The Storefront API has the following types of token-based access:

Public access
: Used to query the API from a browser or mobile app.

Private access
: Used to query the API from a server or other private context, like a Hydrogen backend.

access tokens for the Storefront API
.

Anchor to Endpoints and queries
Endpoints and queries

The Storefront API is available only in GraphQL. There's no REST API for storefronts.

All Storefront API queries are made on a single GraphQL endpoint, which only accepts
POST
 requests:

https://{store_name}.myshopify.com/api/2026-01/graphql.json

Anchor to Versioning
Versioning

The Storefront API is
versioned
, with new releases four times a year. To keep your app stable, make sure that you specify a supported version in the URL.

You can't use Storefront API to duplicate existing Shopify functionality—be sure to check the API terms of service before you start.

Anchor to Directives
Directives

A directive provides a way for apps to describe additional options to the GraphQL executor. It lets GraphQL change the result of the query or mutation based on the additional information provided by the directive.

Anchor to Storefront Directives
Storefront Directives

@inContext (Country Code)

In the Storefront API, the
@inContext
 directive takes an optional
country code argument
 and applies this to the query or mutation.

This example shows how to retrieve a list of available countries and their corresponding currencies for a shop that's located in France
@inContext(country: FR)
.

Examples for localized pricing

GQL directives spec

@inContext (Language)

In the Storefront API, beyond version 2022-04, the
@inContext
 directive can contextualize any query to one of a shop's available languages with an optional
language code argument
.

This example shows how to return a product's
title
,
description
, and
options
 translated into Spanish
@inContext(language: ES)
.

Examples for supporting multiple languages

GQL directives spec

@inContext (Buyer Identity)

In the Storefront API, beyond version 2024-04, the
@inContext
 directive can contextualize any query to a logged in buyer of a shop with an optional
buyer argument
.

This example shows how to return a product's price
amount
 contextualized for a business customer buyer
@inContext(buyer: {customerAccessToken: 'token', companyLocationId: 'gid://shopify/CompanyLocation/1'})
.

Example for supporting a contextualized buyer identity

GraphQL directives spec

@inContext (Visitor Consent)

In the Storefront API, beyond version 2025-10, the
@inContext
 directive can contextualize any query or mutation with visitor consent information using an optional
visitorConsent
 argument.

This example shows how to create a cart with visitor consent preferences
@inContext(visitorConsent: {analytics: true, preferences: true, marketing: false, saleOfData: false})
.

The consent information is automatically encoded and included in the resulting
checkoutUrl
 to ensure privacy compliance throughout the checkout process. All consent fields are optional.

Examples for collecting and passing visitor consent with Checkout Kit

GraphQL directives spec

@defer

The
@defer
 directive allows clients to prioritize part of a GraphQL query without having to make more requests to fetch the remaining information. It does this through streaming, where the first response contains the data that isn't deferred.

The directive accepts two optional arguments:
label
 and
if
. The
label
 is included in the fragment response if it's provided in the directive. When the
if
 argument is
false
, the fragment isn't deferred.

This example shows how to return a product's
title
 and
description
 immediately, and then return the
descriptionHtml
 and
options
 after a short delay.

The
@defer
 directive is available as a
developer preview
 in
unstable
.

Examples for how to use
@defer

Anchor to Rate limits
Rate limits

The Storefront API is designed to support businesses of all sizes. The Storefront API will scale to support surges in buyer traffic or your largest flash sale. There are no rate limits applied on the number of requests that can be made to the API.

The Storefront API provides protection against malicious users, such as bots, from consuming a high level of capacity. If a request appears to be malicious, Shopify will respond with a
430 Shopify Security Rejection

error code
 to indicate potential security concerns. Ensure requests to the Storefront API include the correct
Buyer IP header
.

Learn more about rate limits
.

Anchor to Query complexity limit for tokenless access
Query complexity limit for tokenless access

Tokenless access has a query complexity limit of 1,000. This limit is calculated based on the cost of each field in the query in the same way as the GraphQL Admin API. For more information on how query costs are calculated, see the
Cost calculation
 section in the API rate limits documentation.

When using tokenless access, query complexity that exceeds 1,000 will result in an error.

Anchor to Status and error codes
Status and error codes

All API queries return HTTP status codes that contain more information about the response.

Anchor to 200 OK
200 OK

The Storefront API can return a
200 OK
 response code in cases that would typically produce 4xx errors in REST.

ACCESS_DENIED

The client doesn't have correct
authentication
 credentials. Similar to 401 Unauthorized.

SHOP_INACTIVE

The shop is not active. This can happen when stores repeatedly exceed API rate limits or due to fraud risk.

INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR

Shopify experienced an internal error while processing the request. This error is returned instead of 500 Internal Server Error in most circumstances.

Anchor to 4xx and 5xx status codes
4xx and 5xx status codes

The 4xx and 5xx errors occur infrequently. They are often related to network communications, your account, or an issue with Shopify's services.

Many errors that would typically return a 4xx or 5xx status code, return an HTTP 200 errors response instead. Refer to the
200 OK section
 above for details.

Anchor to [object Object]
400 Bad Request

The server will not process the request.

Anchor to [object Object]
402 Payment Required

The shop is frozen. The shop owner will need to pay the outstanding balance to
unfreeze
 the shop.

Anchor to [object Object]
403 Forbidden

The shop is forbidden. Returned if the store has been marked as fraudulent.
