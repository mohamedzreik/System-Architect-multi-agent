GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and testing GraphQL queries. When working with Shopify's GraphQL Admin API, GraphiQL can be useful for the following tasks:

Learning about the available queries and mutations

Executing specific queries and mutations to extract information or accomplish tasks

For more information on GraphQL Admin API queries, refer to the
GraphQL Admin API reference

To build queries and mutations on your development store,
install Shopify's GraphiQL app
.

Some scopes aren't available within the GraphiQL app. The app also can't be used to access data owned by other apps. If you're developing an app, then you should
use a local GraphiQL instance
 instead.

If you are developing an app using
Shopify CLI
, you can launch GraphiQL while running the
dev
 command by tapping the
g
 key.

Shopify CLI's GraphiQL instance connects as your app, so it has the same access scopes as your app, and it can access data owned by your app. It can't access data owned by other apps.
