Anchor to Authentication
Authentication

To use Hydrogen React, you need to authenticate with and make requests to the
Storefront API
. Hydrogen React includes an
API client
 to securely handle API queries and mutations.

You can create and manage Storefront API access tokens by installing the
Headless sales channel
 on your store.

Apps have access to
two kinds of tokens
: a public API token, which can be used in client-side code, and a private API token, which should only be used in server-side contexts and never exposed publicly.

How Hydrogen React works with Hydrogen

Hydrogen React is bundled as part of Hydrogen, Shopify's opinionated headless commerce stack built on
Remix
. Hydrogen React is also published separately as a standalone package so that it can be used by other React-based frameworks.

Hydrogen adds features like standard routes, caching strategies, redirects, and SEO. When using Hydrogen, you can also install the Hydrogen sales channel, which includes built-in support for Oxygen, Shopify's global edge hosting platform. Consider which approach works best for your use case and existing technology stack.
