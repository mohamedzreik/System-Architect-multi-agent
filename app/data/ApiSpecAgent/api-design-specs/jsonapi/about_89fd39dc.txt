History

JSON:API was originally drafted by
Yehuda Katz

in May 2013. This first draft was extracted from the JSON transport
implicitly defined by
Ember
 Data's REST adapter.

In general, Ember Data's goal is to eliminate the need for ad-hoc code
per application to communicate with servers that communicate in a
well-defined way.

Some servers, like Firebase, Parse and CouchDB already define strict
communication protocols for clients, and were good fits for Ember Data.
In contrast, servers written in Rails, Node, and Django tend to be
written in a "REST-style" but lack the precision necessary for drop-in
client code.

The REST Adapter in Ember Data implicitly defined a protocol that
custom servers could implement to get a drop-in client for all of their
resources.
ActiveModel::Serializers
 is a proof-of-concept library
for Rails that implemented the serialization format expected by Ember
Data.

Record creation, update, and deletion was defined implicitly by the
Ember Data library and was close to conventions already in wide use by
Rails, Django and Node developers.

The goals of the media type are to balance:

A generic media type that can work across a broad set of use cases,
including the generally used relationship types

Similarity to existing server-side framework practices (and human
readability for debugging)

Ease of implementation on the server side

Ease of implementation on the client side

This specification reached a stable version 1.0 on May 29, 2015.

Update history

2022-09-30: 1.1 final released.

2022-08-22: 1.1 Release candidate 4 released.

Formalized the definition of specification and implementation

semantics
.

Refined the definitions of

extensions
 and

profiles
.

Clarified details regarding expected and allowed responses, query
parameters, and more.

2020-10-01: 1.1 Release candidate 3 released.

Refined links objects. The link object
params
 member was removed to
better align with other JSON link serializations. The
anchor
 target
attribute was also removed. It may be restored in a future minor release.

2020-08-20: 1.1 Release candidate 2 released.

Extensions
 were added and the
scope of
profiles
 were reduced
since their introduction in RC1.

Links
 can be represented
as
RFC 8288
-style web links.

A new
describedby

links member

was added so that implementors can incorporate description documents (e.g.

OpenAPI
 or
JSON Schema
)
directly into their APIs.

Local IDs

were
introduced
 so that a
client can create a relationship to a resource yet-to-be created by the
same request.

2018-12-01: 1.1 Release candidate 1 released.

New features include:
profiles
,
"@-Members"
, and
error object
type
 links
.

There are editorial clarifications around:
query parameters
 (their parsing/serialization, and reserved parameter names), the appropriate status code for
specific

responses
, and the
presence of the
included
 key
 even when its value is an empty array.

JSON:API switched to
recommending camelCased names
.

2015-05-29: 1.0 final released.

2015-05-21: 1.0 Release candidate 4 released.

2015-03-16: 1.0 Release candidate 3 released.

2015-02-18: 1.0 Release candidate 2 released.

2014-07-05: 1.0 Release candidate 1 released.

2013-07-21: Media type registration completed with the IANA.

2013-05-03: Initial release of the draft.
