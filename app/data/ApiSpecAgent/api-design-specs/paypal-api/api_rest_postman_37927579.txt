Postman Guide

Use Postman to explore PayPal's REST APIs without a developer account. You can customize requests and receive responses for any of PayPal's core APIs.

You can test APIs right away by forking PayPal's Postman collection. To test an app from your Developer Dashboard, plug in the app's
client_id
 and
client_secret
.

Fork the PayPal Postman collection

postman.com
.

Select the following Run in Postman button:

Select Fork Collection.

Name your fork and select a workspace.

Authenticate an app

Replace the default access token with a
client_id
 and
client_secret
 from an app on the
Developer Dashboard
.

On the Developer Dashboard, find your
client_id
 and
client_secret
 under Dashboard > Apps & Credentials.

In Postman, select your fork of the PayPal collection.

Under the Variables tab, in the CURRENT VALUE column, enter your
client_id
 and
client_secret
.

Select Save.

A script generates and manages the
access_token
 automatically. Use the
access_token
 to call any API in the collection on behalf of your app.

Make API calls with Postman

This example uses the Orders API to create an order and capture payment using
sandbox accounts
 linked to your Developer Dashboard account. To find your sandbox account credentials, log into the Developer Dashboard and select Sandbox > Accounts.

To create an order:

In your Postman workspace, navigate to your fork of the PayPal collection.

Select Orders > Create Order > Send. On a successful call, the API returns a 201 order created response code.

Find the approve link in the response.

Open the approve link in a browser.

Capture Payments

Capture payments in both your personal and business sandbox accounts as follows:

Find the
id
 in the response of the order you created and copy the value.

Select your fork of the PayPal collection.

In the Variables tab, enter the value you copied in the
order_id
 field.

Select Orders > Capture payment for order.

Select Send. A successful call returns an HTTP
201 order created
 response code.
