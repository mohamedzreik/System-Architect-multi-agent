PayPal application policies and guidelines

Use the following policies, guidelines, and best practices when you create applications that make calls to PayPal API operations:

To make API calls to the PayPal production servers, you must be a registered PayPal Developer and have a

PayPal Business Account

in good standing.

The Merchant/Seller of Record must be the primary recipient for every PayPal transaction made between a payment Sender (Buyer) and the associated payment Recipient (Seller).

You must read and adhere to the guidelines listed in the

PayPal Developer Agreement

.

Publicly post an

Acceptable Use Policy

(AUP) and legal agreement that aligns with PayPal's guidelines. (You may link to PayPal's policies if you do not want to create your own.)

Meet PayPal's

Security guidelines

if you're using the Pre-approval or Authentication APIs.

Provide your customers with information regarding your Customer Support Policy and include a Customer Support email address. In addition, we recommend you provide a Customer Support telephone number and an accompanying support website.

Publish a Refund Policy and a Privacy Policy.

If your application supports 501(c)3 non-profit organizations, each non-profit using your application must be prepared to provide proof of its non-profit status.

To understand how PayPal manages site traffic and when rate limiting may be used, see

Rate limiting guidelines

.

In addition to the previous guidelines, be aware of the following restrictions:

Do not provide any escrow service or any other other type of holding service that violates PayPal's

Acceptable Use Policy

.

Do not use PayPal for payment aggregation. Aggregating money from unverifiable funding sources, either going into or out of a PayPal account, is forbidden. All payments must flow directly from the Sender's PayPal account to the PayPal account of the entity that sold the associated good or service.

Do not transfer fees to a Sender (Buyer), and don't add surcharges to the transactions that you provide through PayPal services.

Do not store or collect PayPal user login credentials, passwords, PINs, or answers to security questions.

Do not use PayPal API operation calls to provide personal payments in India, Mexico, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan.

Do not expand personal payments or provide remittance services for any transactions provided through PayPal services.

Do not circumvent any PayPal policies or engage in any PayPal fee avoidance.

Lastly, before you can make calls to the live PayPal production servers, you must
register your application with PayPal
.

Note

If your application calls any advanced Adaptive API operations, PayPal passes your application through a review phase. For details about how to move your application into the PayPal production environment, see
