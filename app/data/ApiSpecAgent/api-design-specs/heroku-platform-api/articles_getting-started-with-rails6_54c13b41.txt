Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework written in
Ruby
. This guide covers using Rails 8 on Heroku. For information on running previous versions of Rails on Heroku, see the tutorial for
Rails 7.x
 or
Rails 6.x
.

The tutorial assumes that you have:

Basic familiarity with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Git

A locally installed version of Ruby 3.2.0+, Rubygems, Bundler, and Rails 8+

A locally installed version of the
Heroku CLI

A
verified Heroku Account

A subscription to the
Eco dynos plan
 (recommended)

Using dynos and databases to complete this tutorial counts towards your usage. We recommend using our
low-cost plans
 to complete this tutorial. Eligible students can apply for platform credits through our new
Heroku for GitHub Students program
.

Local Setup

After installing the
Heroku CLI
, log in through your terminal:

$ heroku login
heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit
 › Warning: If browser does not open, visit
 › https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/browser/***
heroku: Waiting for login...
Logging in... done
Logged in as developer@example.com

This command opens your web browser to the Heroku login page. If your browser is already logged in to Heroku, click the
 button on the page.

This authentication is required for the
heroku
 and
git
 commands to work correctly.

If you're behind a firewall that uses a proxy to connect with external HTTP/HTTPS services,
set the
HTTP_PROXY
 or
HTTPS_PROXY
 environment variables
 in your local development environment before running the
heroku
 command.

Create a New or Upgrade an Existing Rails App

Ensure you have Rails 8 installed by running
rails -v
 before creating an app. If necessary, install Rails 8 with
gem install
:

$ gem install rails --no-document
Successfully installed rails-8.1.1
1 gem installed

Create a Rails app:

$ rails new myapp --database=postgresql

Move into the application directory

$ cd myapp
$ ls -1
app
bin
config
config.ru
db
Dockerfile
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
lib
log
public
Rakefile
README.md
script
storage
test
tmp
vendor

Create a local database:

$ bin/rails db:create

Database 'myapp_development' already exists
Database 'myapp_test' already exists

Add the pg Gem

For new or existing apps where
--database=postgresql
 isn't defined, confirm the
sqlite3
 gem doesn't exist in the
Gemfile
. Add the
pg
 gem in its place.

Within the
Gemfile
 remove:

gem 'sqlite3'

Replace it with:

gem 'pg'

Heroku highly recommends using PostgreSQL locally during development. Maintaining
parity between development
 and deployment environments prevents introducing subtle bugs due to the differences in environments.

Install Postgres locally
. For more information on why Postgres is recommended instead of Sqlite3, see
why Sqlite3 is not compatible with Heroku
.

With the
Gemfile
 updated, reinstall the dependencies:

$ bundle install

The installation also updates
Gemfile.lock
 with the changes.

In addition to the
pg
 gem, ensure that
config/database.yml
 defines the
postgresql
 adapter. The development section of
config/database.yml
 file looks something like this:

$ cat config/database.yml
# PostgreSQL. Versions 9.3 and up are supported.
#
# Install the pg driver:
# gem install pg
# On macOS with Homebrew:
# gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/opt/homebrew/bin/pg_config
# On Windows:
# gem install pg
# Choose the win32 build.
# Install PostgreSQL and put its /bin directory on your path.
#
# Configure Using Gemfile
# gem "pg"
#
default: &default
 adapter: postgresql
 encoding: unicode
 # For details on connection pooling, see Rails configuration guide
 # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#database-pooling
 max_connections: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>

development:
 <<: *default
 database: myapp_development

 # The specified database role being used to connect to PostgreSQL.
 # To create additional roles in PostgreSQL see `$ createuser --help`.
 # When left blank, PostgreSQL will use the default role. This is
 # the same name as the operating system user running Rails.
 #username: myapp

 # The password associated with the PostgreSQL role (username).
 #password:

 # Connect on a TCP socket. Omitted by default since the client uses a
 # domain socket that doesn't need configuration. Windows does not have
 # domain sockets, so uncomment these lines.
 #host: localhost

 # The TCP port the server listens on. Defaults to 5432.
 # If your server runs on a different port number, change accordingly.
 #port: 5432

 # Schema search path. The server defaults to $user,public
 #schema_search_path: myapp,sharedapp,public

 # Minimum log levels, in increasing order:
 # debug5, debug4, debug3, debug2, debug1,
 # log, notice, warning, error, fatal, and panic
 # Defaults to warning.
 #min_messages: notice

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
 <<: *default
 database: myapp_test

# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#
# DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# If the connection URL is provided in the special DATABASE_URL environment
# variable, Rails will automatically merge its configuration values on top of
# the values provided in this file. Alternatively, you can specify a connection
# URL environment variable explicitly:
#
# production:
# url: <%= ENV["MY_APP_DATABASE_URL"] %>
#
# Connection URLs for non-primary databases can also be configured using
# environment variables. The variable name is formed by concatenating the
# connection name with `_DATABASE_URL`. For example:
#
# CACHE_DATABASE_URL="postgres://cacheuser:cachepass@localhost/cachedatabase"
#
# Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full overview on how database connection configuration can be specified.
#
production:
 primary: &primary_production
 <<: *default
 database: myapp_production
 username: myapp
 password: <%= ENV["MYAPP_DATABASE_PASSWORD"] %>
 cache:
 <<: *primary_production
 database: myapp_production_cache
 migrations_paths: db/cache_migrate
 queue:
 <<: *primary_production
 database: myapp_production_queue
 migrations_paths: db/queue_migrate
 cable:
 <<: *primary_production
 database: myapp_production_cable
 migrations_paths: db/cable_migrate

Be careful here. If the value of
adapter
 is
postgres
 and not
postgresql
, the application won't work.

Create a Welcome Page

Rails 8 no longer has a static index page in production by default. Apps upgraded to Rails 8 keep their existing page configurations, but new Rails 8 apps don't automatically generate a welcome page. Create a
welcome
 controller to hold the homepage:

$ rails generate controller welcome

Create
app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
 and add the following code:

<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>
 The time is now: <%= Time.now %>
</p>

With a welcome page created, create a route to map to this action.

In file
config/routes.rb
, on line 2 add:

 root 'welcome#index'

Verify the page is present by starting the Rails web server:

$ rails server

Visit
http://localhost:3000
 in a browser. If the page doesn't display,
reference the logs
 to debug the error. Rails outputs logs in the same terminal where
rails server
 was started.

Specify the Ruby Version

Rails 8 requires Ruby 3.2.0 or above. Heroku installs a recent version of Ruby by default. Specify an exact version with the
ruby
 DSL in
Gemfile
. For example:

ruby "3.2.9"

Update the
RUBY VERSION
 in the
Gemfile.lock
 by running:

$ bundle update --ruby
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.........
Resolving dependencies...
Bundle updated!
1 installed gem you directly depend on is looking for funding.
 Run `bundle fund` for details

Verify the change:

$ cat Gemfile.lock | grep RUBY -a1

RUBY VERSION
 ruby 3.2.9p265

Always use the same version of Ruby locally. Confirm the local version of ruby with
ruby -v
. Refer to the
Ruby Versions
 article for more details on defining a specific ruby version.

Create a Procfile

Use a
Procfile
, a text file in the root directory of your application, to explicitly declare what command to execute to start your app.

This Procfile declares a single process type,
web
, and the command needed to run it. The name
web
 is important here. It declares that this process type is attached to Heroku's
HTTP routing
 stack and receives web traffic when deployed.

By default, a Rails app's web process runs
rails server
, which uses Puma in Rails 8. When you deploy a Rails 8 application without a
Procfile
, this command executes. However, we recommend explicitly declaring how to boot your server process via a
Procfile
. For example:

web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb

The
Procfile
 filename is case sensitive. There is no file extension.

If
config/puma.rb
 doesn't exist, create one using
Heroku's Puma documentation
 for maximum performance.

A Procfile can contain additional process types. For example, you can declare a
background worker process
 that processes items off a queue.

Store The App in Git

Heroku relies on
Git
, a distributed source control management tool, for deploying applications. If the application is not already in Git, first verify that
git
 is on the system with
git --help
:

$ git --help
usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
 [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
 [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--no-lazy-fetch]
 [--no-optional-locks] [--no-advice] [--bare] [--git-dir=<path>]
 [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]

If the command produces no output or
command not found
,
install Git
.

Navigate to the root directory of the Rails app. Use the
ls
 command to see its contents:

$ ls
app
bin
config
config.ru
db
Dockerfile
Gemfile
Gemfile-e
Gemfile.lock
lib
log
Procfile
public
Rakefile
README.md
script
storage
test
tmp
vendor

Within the Rails app directly, initialize a local empty Git repository and commit the app's code:

$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "init"

Verify everything committed correctly with
git status
:

$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean

With the application committed to Git, it's ready to deploy to Heroku.

Create a Heroku App

Using a dyno and a database to complete this tutorial counts towards your usage.
Delete your app
, and
database
 as soon as you're done to control costs.

To create an app on Heroku, use the Heroku CLI Inside the Rails app's root directory:

$ heroku apps:create
Creating app...
Creating app... done, quiet-escarpment-74379
https://quiet-escarpment-74379-83955fa5b8df.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/quiet-escarpment-74379.git

When you create an app, a git remote called
heroku
 is also created and associated with your local git repository. Git remotes are versions of your repository that live on other servers. You deploy your app by pushing its code to that special Heroku-hosted remote associated with your app. Verify the remote is set with
git config
:

$ git config --list --local | grep heroku
remote.heroku.url=https://git.heroku.com/quiet-escarpment-74379.git
remote.heroku.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/heroku/*

If the current directory is incorrect or Git isn't
initialized
, Git returns
fatal: not in a git directory
. If Git returns a list of remotes, it's ready to deploy.

Following changes in the industry, Heroku
updated the default branch name
 to
main
. If the project uses
master
 as its default branch name, use
git push heroku master
.

Provision a Database

Provision a
Heroku Postgres
 database, one of the add-ons available through the
Elements Marketplace
. Add-ons are cloud services that provide out-of-the-box additional services for your application, such as logging, monitoring, databases, and more.

A
mini
 Postgres size costs
$5 a month, prorated to the minute
. At the end of this tutorial, we prompt you to
delete your database
 to minimize costs.

$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:essential-0
Creating heroku-postgresql:essential-0 on quiet-escarpment-74379...
Creating heroku-postgresql:essential-0 on quiet-escarpment-74379... ~$0.007/hour (max $5/month)
Database should be available soon
postgresql-graceful-86162 is being created in the background. The app will restart when complete...
Use heroku addons:info postgresql-graceful-86162 to check creation progress
Use heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql to view documentation

Your Heroku app can now access this Postgres database. The
DATABASE_URL
 environment variable stores your credentials, which Rails connects to by convention.

Deploy the App to Heroku

Using a dyno to complete this tutorial counts towards your usage.
Delete your app
 as soon as you're done to control costs.

Deploy your code. This command pushes the
main
 branch of the sample repo to your
heroku
 remote, which then deploys to Heroku:

$ git push heroku main
remote: Updated 114 paths from 1f3201b

If the output displays warnings or error messages, check the output and make adjustments.

After a successful deployment, complete these tasks as necessary:

Database migrations

Scale your dynos

Check the app's logs if issues arise

Migrate The Database

If you're using a database in your application, trigger a migration by using the Heroku CLI to start a one-off
dyno
. You can run commands, typically scripts and applications that are part of your app, in one-off dynos using the
heroku run
 command. You can trigger a database migration with this command:

$ heroku run rake db:migrate

To use an interactive shell session instead, you can execute
heroku run bash
.

Scale and Access the Application

Heroku runs application code using defined processes and
process types
. New applications don't have a process type active by default. The following command scales your app up to one dyno, running the
web
 process:

$ heroku ps:scale web=1

Use the Heroku CLI's
ps
 command to display the state of all app dynos in the terminal:

$ heroku ps
=== web (Basic): bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb (1)

web.1: up 2025/11/17 20:02:52 -0600 (~ 6s ago)

In this example, a single
web
 process is running.

By default, apps use Eco dynos if you're subscribed to
Eco
. Otherwise, it defaults to Basic dynos. The Eco dynos plan is shared across all Eco dynos in your account and is recommended if you plan on deploying many small apps to Heroku. Eco dynos sleep if they don't receive any traffic for half an hour. This sleep behavior causes a few seconds delay for the first request upon waking. Eco dynos consume from a monthly, account-level quota of
eco dyno hours
. As long as you haven't exhausted the quota, your apps can continue to run.

To avoid dyno sleeping, upgrade to a Basic or higher dyno type as described in the
Dyno Types
 article. Upgrading to at least Standard dynos also allows you to scale up to multiple dynos per process type.

To launch the app in the browser, run
heroku open
:

$ heroku open

The browser displays the "Hello World" text. If it doesn't, or there's an error,
review and confirm the welcome page contents
.

Heroku provides a
default web URL
 for every application during development. When the application is ready for production, add a
custom domain
.

Append
-t
/
--tail
 to the command to see a full, live stream of the app's logs:

$ heroku logs --tail

By default, Heroku stores 1500 lines of logs from your application, but the full log stream is available as a service. Several
add-on providers
 have logging services that provide things such as log persistence, search, and email and SMS alerts.

Optional Steps

Use The Rails Console

Use the Heroku CLI
run
 command to trigger
one-off dynos
 to run scripts and applications only when necessary. Use the command to launch a Rails console process attached to the local terminal for experimenting in the app's environment:

$ heroku run rails console
irb(main):001:0> puts 1+1
2

The
run bash
 Heroku CLI command is also helpful for debugging. The command starts a new one-off dyno with an interactive bash session.

Run Rake Commands

Run
rake
 commands, such as
db:migrate
, using the
run
 command exactly like the Rails console:

$ heroku run rake db:migrate

Use a Procfile locally

To use the
Procfile
 locally, use the
heroku local
 CLI command.

In addition to running commands in the
Procfile
, the
heroku local
 command can also manage environment variables locally through a
.env
 file. Set
RACK_ENV
 to
development
 for the local environment and the
PORT
 for Puma.

$ echo "RACK_ENV=development" >>.env
$ echo "PORT=3000" >> .env

Another alternative to using environment variables locally with a
.env
 file is the
dotenv
 gem.

Add
.env
 to
.gitignore
 as these variables are for local environment setup only.

$ echo ".env" >> .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "add .env to .gitignore"

Test the Procfile locally using
Foreman
​​. Start the web server with
local
:

$ heroku local

Ctrl+C
 or
Cmd+C
 to exit.

Troubleshooting

If an app deployed to Heroku crashes, for example,
heroku ps
 shows the state
crashed
, review the app's logs. The following section covers common causes of app crashes.

Runtime Dependencies on Development or Test Gems

If a gem is missing during deployment, check the Bundler groups. Heroku builds apps without the
development
 or
test
 groups, and if the app depends on a gem from one of these groups to run, move it out of the group.

A common example is using the RSpec tasks in the
Rakefile
. The error often looks like this:

$ heroku run rake -T
Running `bundle exec rake -T` attached to terminal... up, ps.3
rake aborted!
no such file to load -- rspec/core/rake_task

First, duplicate the problem locally by running
bundle install
 without the development or test gem groups:

$ bundle install --without development:test
…
$ bundle exec rake -T
rake aborted!
no such file to load -- rspec/core/rake_task

The
--without
 option on
bundler
 is persistent. To remove this option, run
bundle config --delete without
.

Fix the error by making these Rake tasks conditional during gem load. For example:

begin
 require "rspec/core/rake_task"

 desc "Run all examples"

 RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:spec) do |t|
 t.rspec_opts = %w[--color]
 t.pattern = 'spec/**/*_spec.rb'
 end
rescue LoadError
end

Confirm it works locally, then push it to Heroku.

Congratulations on deploying a Rails 8 application! To continue exploring, review the following articles next:

Visit the
Ruby support category
 to learn more about using Ruby and Rails on Heroku.

The
Deployment category
 provides a variety of powerful integrations and features to help streamline and simplify your deployments.

Remember to
delete your example app
, and
database
 as soon as you're done with the tutorial, to control costs.

Delete Your App and Add-on

Remove the app and database from your account. You're only charged for the resources you used.

This action removes your add-on and any data saved in the database.

$ heroku addons:destroy heroku-postgresql

This action permanently deletes your application

$ heroku apps:destroy

You can confirm that your add-on and app are gone with these commands:

$ heroku addons --all
$ heroku apps --all

You're now ready to
deploy your app
.
