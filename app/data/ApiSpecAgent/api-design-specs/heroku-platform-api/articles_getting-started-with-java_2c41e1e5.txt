Getting Started on Heroku with Java | Heroku Dev Center

Getting Started on Heroku with Java

Complete this tutorial to deploy a sample Java app to
Cedar
, the legacy generation of the Heroku platform. To deploy the app to the
Fir
 generation, only available to
Heroku Private Spaces
, follow this
guide
 instead.

The tutorial assumes that you have:

A
verified Heroku Account

OpenJDK 17
 (or newer) installed locally

Postgres
 installed locally

An
Eco dynos plan
 subscription (recommended)

If you prefer to use Gradle instead of Maven, see the
Getting Started with Gradle on Heroku
 guide.

Using dynos and databases to complete this tutorial counts towards your usage. We recommend using our
low-cost plans
 to complete this tutorial. Eligible students can apply for platform credits through our new
Heroku for GitHub Students program
.

Set Up

Install the
Heroku Command Line Interface
 (CLI). Use the CLI to manage and scale your app, provision add-ons, view your logs, and run your app locally.

The Heroku CLI requires
Git
, the popular version control system. If you don't already have Git installed, complete the following before proceeding:

Git installation

First-time Git setup

Download and run the installer for your platform:

macOS

Install Homebrew
 and run:

$ brew install heroku/brew/heroku

Windows

Download the appropriate installer for your Windows installation:

64-bit installer

32-bit installer

You can find more installation options for the Heroku CLI
here
.

After installation, you can use the
heroku
 command from your command shell.

On Windows, start the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or Powershell to access the command shell.

To log in to the Heroku CLI, use the
heroku login
 command:

$ heroku login
heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/***
heroku: Waiting for login...
Logging in... done
Logged in as me@example.com

This command opens your web browser to the Heroku login page. If your browser is already logged in to Heroku, click the
 button on the page.

This authentication is required for the
heroku
 and
git
 commands to work correctly.

If you have any problems installing or using the Heroku CLI, see the main
Heroku CLI
 article for advice and troubleshooting steps.

If you're behind a firewall that uses a proxy to connect with external HTTP/HTTPS services,
set the
HTTP_PROXY
 or
HTTPS_PROXY
 environment variables
 in your local development environment before running the
heroku
 command.

Prepare the App

If you're new to Heroku, it's recommended to complete
this tutorial using the Heroku-provided sample application.

If you have your own application that you want to deploy
instead, see
Preparing a Codebase for Heroku Deployment
.

Create a local copy of the sample app by executing the following commands in your local command shell or terminal:

$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/java-getting-started
$ cd java-getting-started

This functioning Git repository contains a sample Java application. It includes a
pom.xml
 file, which is used by Maven, a Java build tool.

Create Your App

Using a dyno and a database to complete this tutorial counts towards your usage.
Delete your app
, and
database
 as soon as you're done to control costs.

By default, apps use Eco dynos if you're subscribed to Eco. Otherwise, it defaults to Basic dynos. The Eco dynos plan is shared across all Eco dynos in your account and is recommended if you plan on deploying many small apps to Heroku. Learn more
here
. Eligible students can apply for platform credits through our
Heroku for GitHub Students program
.

To prepare Heroku to receive your source code, create an app:

$ heroku create
Creating app... done, ⬢ peaceful-inlet-84135
http://peaceful-inlet-84135.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/peaceful-inlet-84135.git

When you create an app, a git remote called
heroku
 is also created and associated with your local git repository. Git remotes are versions of your repository that live on other servers. You deploy your app by pushing its code to that special Heroku-hosted remote associated with your app.

Heroku generates a random name for your app, in this case,
peaceful-inlet-84135
. You can
specify your own app name
.

Define a Procfile

Use a
Procfile
, a text file in the root directory of your application, to explicitly declare what command to execute to start your app.

The
Procfile
 in the example app looks like this:

web: java -jar target/java-getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

This Procfile declares a single process type,
web
, and the command needed to run it. The name
web
 is important here. It declares that this process type is attached to Heroku's
HTTP routing
 stack and receives web traffic when deployed.

A Procfile can contain additional process types. For example, you can declare a
background worker process
 that processes items off a queue.

Provision a Database

The sample app requires a database. Provision a
Heroku Postgres
 database, one of the add-ons available through the
Elements Marketplace
. Add-ons are cloud services that provide out-of-the-box additional services for your application, such as logging, monitoring, databases, and more.

An
essential-0
 Postgres size costs
$5 a month, prorated to the minute
.
Delete your database
 after completing this guide to minimize costs.

$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:essential-0
Creating heroku-postgresql:essential-0 on ⬢ peaceful-inlet-84135... ~$0.007/hour (max $5/month)
Database should be available soon
postgresql-fitted-70383 is being created in the background. The app will restart when complete...
Use heroku addons:info postgresql-fitted-70383 to check creation progress
Use heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql to view documentation

Your Heroku app now has access to a Postgres database. The
DATABASE_URL
 environment variable stores the credentials. Heroku also automatically makes a
JDBC_DATABASE_URL
 environment variable available for Java applications. It contains a JDBC-compatible version of
DATABASE_URL
.

You can see all the add-ons provisioned with the
addons
 command:

$ heroku addons
Add-on Plan Price State
─────────────────────────────────────────── ─────────── ──────── ───────
heroku-postgresql (postgresql-fitted-70383) essential-0 $5/month created
 └─ as DATABASE

The table above shows add-ons and the attachments to the current app (peaceful-inlet-84135) or other apps.

Deploy the App

Deploy your code. This command pushes the
main
 branch of the sample repo to your
heroku
 remote, which then deploys to Heroku:

$ git push heroku main

By default, apps use Eco dynos if you're subscribed to
Eco
. A dyno is a lightweight Linux container that runs the command specified in your
Procfile
. After deployment, ensure that you have one
web

dyno
 running the app. You can check how many dynos are running using the
heroku ps
 command:

$ heroku ps
Eco dyno hours quota remaining this month: 1000h 0m (100%)
Eco dyno usage for this app: 0h 0m (0%)
For more information on Eco dyno hours, see:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/eco-dyno-hours

=== web (Eco): java -jar target/java-getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (1)
web.1: up 2023/03/09 17:00:28 +0100 (~ 1m ago)

The running
web
 dyno serves requests. Visit the app at the URL shown in the logs. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website with:

$ heroku open

The Eco dynos plan is shared across all Eco dynos in your account and is recommended if you plan on deploying many small apps to Heroku. Eco dynos sleep if they don't receive any traffic for half an hour. This sleep behavior causes a few seconds delay for the first request upon waking. Eco dynos consume from a monthly, account-level quota of
eco dyno hours
. As long as you haven't exhausted the quota, your apps can continue to run.

To avoid dyno sleeping, upgrade to a Basic or Professional dyno type as described in
Dyno Types
.

Scale the App

Horizontal scaling an application on Heroku is equivalent to changing the number of running dynos.

Scale the number of web dynos to zero:

$ heroku ps:scale web=0

Access the app again by refreshing your browser or running
heroku open
. You get an error message because your app no longer has any web dynos available to serve requests.

Scale it up again:

$ heroku ps:scale web=1

You can also vertically scale your app by upgrading to larger dynos. See
Dyno Types
 and
Scaling Your Dyno Formation
 for more info.

View Logs

Heroku treats logs as streams of time-ordered events, aggregated from the output streams of all your app and Heroku components. Heroku provides a single stream for all events.

View information about your running app by using one of the
logging commands
,
heroku logs --tail
:

$ heroku logs --tail

To see more log messages generate, visit your application in the browser first.

To stop streaming the logs, press
Control+C
.

Provision a Logging Add-on

Add-ons are third-party cloud services that provide out-of-the-box additional services for your application, from persistence through logging to monitoring and more.

By default, Heroku stores 1500 lines of logs from your application, but the full log stream is available as a service. Several add-on providers have logging services that provide things such as log persistence, search, and email and SMS alerts.

In this step, you provision one of these logging add-ons,
Papertrail
.

Provision the Papertrail logging add-on:

$ heroku addons:create papertrail
Creating papertrail on ⬢ peaceful-inlet-84135... free
Welcome to Papertrail. Questions and ideas are welcome (technicalsupport@solarwinds.com). Happy logging!
Created papertrail-slippery-84785 as PAPERTRAIL_API_TOKEN
Use heroku addons:docs papertrail to view documentation

The add-on is now deployed and configured for your application. You can list add-ons for your app with this command:

$ heroku addons

To see this particular add-on in action, visit your application's Heroku URL a few times. Each visit generates more log messages, which get routed to the Papertrail add-on. Visit the Papertrail console to see the log messages:

$ heroku addons:open papertrail

Your browser opens up a Papertrail web console that shows the latest log events. The interface lets you search and set up alerts.

Use a Database

Heroku provides managed data services for Postgres and Redis, and the
add-on marketplace
 provides additional data services, including MongoDB and MySQL.

Use the
heroku addons
 command for an overview of the database provisioned for your app:

$ heroku addons

Add-on Plan Price State
─────────────────────────────────────────── ─────────── ──────── ───────
heroku-postgresql (postgresql-fitted-70383) essential-0 $5/month created
 └─ as DATABASE

papertrail (papertrail-slippery-84785) choklad free created
 └─ as PAPERTRAIL

Listing the config vars for your app displays the URL that your app uses to connect to the database,
DATABASE_URL
:

$ heroku config
=== peaceful-inlet-84135 Config Vars
DATABASE_URL: postgres://avhrhofbiyvpct:3ab23026d0fc225bde4544cedabc356904980e6a02a2418ca44d7fd19dad8e03@ec2-23-21-4-7.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d8e8ojni26668k
PAPERTRAIL_API_TOKEN: ChtIUu9fHbij1cBn7y6z

The
heroku pg
 command provides more in-depth information on your app's Heroku Postgres databases:

$ heroku pg
=== DATABASE_URL
Plan: Essential 0
Status: Available
Connections: 0/20
PG Version: 15.5

Tables: 0
Fork/Follow: Unsupported
Rollback: Unsupported
Continuous Protection: Off
Add-on: postgresql-fitted-70383

Running this command for your app indicates that the app has an
essential-0
 Postgres database running Postgres 15.5, with no tables.

The example app you deployed already has database functionality, which you can reach by visiting your app's
/database
 path.

$ heroku open /database

You see something like this:

Database Output

* Read from DB: 2023-03-09 16:58:55.816605
* Read from DB: 2023-03-09 16:58:56.728701
* Read from DB: 2023-03-09 16:58:57.064755

Assuming that you have
Postgres installed locally
, use the
heroku pg:psql
 command to connect to the remote database and see all the rows:

$ heroku pg:psql

 2023-03-09 16:58:57.064755
(3 rows)

peaceful-inlet-84135::DATABASE=> \q

The following info illustrates how the example app implements its database functionality. Don't change your example app code in this step

The code in the example app looks like this:

private final DataSource dataSource;

@Autowired
public GettingStartedApplication(DataSource dataSource) {
 this.dataSource = dataSource;
}

@GetMapping("/database")
String database(Map<String, Object> model) {
 try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()) {
 final var statement = connection.createStatement();
 statement.executeUpdate("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ticks (tick timestamp)");
 statement.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO ticks VALUES (now())");

 final var resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT tick FROM ticks");
 final var output = new ArrayList<>();
 while (resultSet.next()) {
 output.add("Read from DB: " + resultSet.getTimestamp("tick"));
 }

 model.put("records", output);
 return "database";

 } catch (Throwable t) {
 model.put("message", t.getMessage());
 return "error";
 }
}

The
database
 method adds a row to the
tick
 table when you access your app using the
/database
 route. It then returns all rows to render in the output.

The
DataSource
 shown in the example app code is automatically configured and injected by the Spring Boot framework. It refers to the values in the
src/main/resources/application.properties
 file for the database connection configuration.

The example app has
spring.datasource.url
 set to the value in the
JDBC_DATABASE_URL
 environment variable to establish a pool of connections to the database:

spring.datasource.url: ${JDBC_DATABASE_URL}

The official Heroku Java buildpack that's automatically added to your app
sets this
JDBC_DATABASE_URL
 environment variable when a dyno starts up. This variable is dynamic and doesn't appear in your list of configuration variables when running
heroku config
. You can view it by running the following command:

$ heroku run echo \$JDBC_DATABASE_URL

Read more about
Heroku PostgreSQL
. You can also install
Redis or other data add-ons
 via
heroku addons:create
.

Prepare the Local Environment

You must install your app's dependencies before you can run your app locally.

Run
./mvnw clean install
 in your local directory. This command installs the dependencies to your local environment, preparing your system to run the app locally.

$ ./mvnw clean install
...

The Maven process compiles and builds a JAR, with dependencies, placing it into your application's
target
 directory. The
spring-boot-maven-plugin
 in the
pom.xml
 provides this process.

After installing dependencies, you can run your app locally but it still requires a Postgres database. Create a local Postgres database and update your local
.env
 file.

heroku local
, the command used to run apps locally, automatically sets up your environment based on the
.env
 file in your app's root directory. Set the
JDBC_DATABASE_URL
 environment variable with your local Postgres database's connection string:

JDBC_DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/java_database_name

Your local environment is now ready to run your app and connect to the database.

Run the App Locally

Ensure you've already run
./mvnw clean install
 before running your app locally.

Start your application locally with the
heroku local
 CLI command
:

$ heroku local --port 5001
...

Just like the Heroku platform,
heroku local
 examines your
Procfile
 to determine what command to run.

To see your app running locally, open
http://localhost:5001
 with your web browser

If you want to access the app's
/database
 route locally, ensure that your local Postgres database is running before you visit the URL.

To stop the app from running locally, go back to your terminal window and press
Control+C
 to exit.

Push Local Changes

In this step, you make local changes to your app and deploy them to Heroku.

Modify
pom.xml
 to include a dependency for
jscience
 by adding the following code inside the
<dependencies>
 element:

In the file
pom.xml
, add the following dependency to the
<dependencies>
 element:

<dependency>
 <groupId>org.jscience</groupId>
 <artifactId>jscience</artifactId>
 <version>4.3.1</version>
</dependency>

In the file
src/main/java/com/heroku/java/GettingStartedApplication.java
, add the following
import
 statements for the library:

import org.jscience.physics.amount.Amount;
import org.jscience.physics.model.RelativisticModel;
import javax.measure.unit.SI;

In the file
GettingStartedApplication.java
, add the following
convert
 method:

@GetMapping("/convert")
String convert(Map<String, Object> model) {
 RelativisticModel.select();
 var energy = Amount.valueOf("12 GeV");

 model.put("result", "E=mc^2: " + energy + " = " + energy.to(SI.KILOGRAM));
 return "convert";
}

Finally, create a
src/main/resources/templates/convert.html
 file with these contents:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org" th:replace="~{fragments/layout :: layout (~{::body},'hello')}">
<body>

<div class="container">
 <p th:text="${result}"/>
</div>

</body>
</html>

Visit your application's
/convert
 path at
http://localhost:5001/convert
, which displays some scientific conversions:

E=mc^2: 12 GeV = (2.139194076302506E-26 ± 1.4E-42) kg

After testing, deploy your changes. Almost every Heroku deployment follows this same pattern. First, use the
git add
 command to stage your modified files for commit:

$ git add .

Next, commit the changes to the repository:

$ git commit -m "Add convert endpoint"

Now deploy as you did before:

$ git push heroku main

Finally, check that your updated code successfully deployed by opening your browser to that route:

$ heroku open /convert

Define Config Vars

Heroku lets you externalize your app's configuration by storing data such as encryption keys or external resource addresses in
config vars
.

At runtime, config vars are exposed to your app as environment variables. For example, modify
GettingStartedApplication.java
 so that the method obtains an energy value from the
ENERGY
 environment variable:

In the file
src/main/java/com/heroku/java/GettingStartedApplication.java
, change the
convert
 method:

@GetMapping("/convert")
String convert(Map<String, Object> model) {
 RelativisticModel.select();

 final var result = java.util.Optional
 .ofNullable(System.getenv().get("ENERGY"))
 .map(Amount::valueOf)
 .map(energy -> "E=mc^2: " + energy + " = " + energy.to(SI.KILOGRAM))
 .orElse("ENERGY environment variable is not set!");

 model.put("result", result);
 return "convert";
}

Recompile the app to integrate this change by running
./mvnw clean install
.

heroku local
 automatically sets up your local environment based on the
.env
 file in your app's root directory. Your sample app already includes a
.env
 file with the following contents:

ENERGY=20 GeV

Your local
.env
 file also includes the
JDBC_DATABASE_URL
 variable if you set it during the
Run the App Locally
 step.

Don't commit the
.env
 file to version control as it often includes secure credentials. Include
.env
 in your repo's
.gitignore
 file. The sample app repo only includes a
.env
 file as an example for this tutorial step.

Run the app with
heroku local --port 5001
 and visit
http://localhost:5001/convert
 to see the conversion value for 20 GeV.

Now that you know it works as expected locally, set this variable as a config var on your app running on Heroku. Execute the following:

$ heroku config:set ENERGY="20 GeV"
Setting ENERGY and restarting ⬢ peaceful-inlet-84135... done, v9
ENERGY: 20 GeV

View the app's config vars using
heroku config
 to verify it's set correctly:

$ heroku config
=== peaceful-inlet-84135 Config Vars
DATABASE_URL: postgres://avhrhofbiyvpct:3ab23026d0fc225bde4544cedabc356904980e6a02a2418ca44d7fd19dad8e03@ec2-23-21-4-7.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d8e8ojni26668k
ENERGY: 20 GeV
PAPERTRAIL_API_TOKEN: ChtIUu9fHbij1cBn7y6z

To see your changes in action, deploy your local changes to Heroku and visit the
/convert
 route :

$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Use ENERGY environment variable"
$ git push heroku main
$ heroku open /convert

Start a One-off Dyno

The
heroku run
 command lets you run maintenance and administrative tasks on your app in a
one-off dyno
. It also lets you launch a REPL process attached to your local terminal for experimenting in your app's environment or your deployed application code:

$ heroku run java -version
Running java -version on ⬢ peaceful-inlet-84135... up, run.4406 (Eco)
openjdk version "17.0.6" 2023-01-17 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.40+19-CA (build 17.0.6+10-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu17.40+19-CA (build 17.0.6+10-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)

If you receive an error,
Error connecting to process
,
configure your firewall
.

Remember to type
exit
 to exit the shell and terminate the dyno.

Congratulations! You now know how to deploy an app, change its configuration, scale it, view logs, attach add-ons, and run it locally.

Here's some recommended reading to continue your Heroku journey:

How Heroku Works
 provides a technical overview of the concepts encountered while writing, configuring, deploying, and running apps.

The
Java category
 provides more in-depth information on developing and deploying Java apps.

The
Deployment category
 provides a variety of powerful integrations and features to help streamline and simplify your deployments.

Remember to
delete your example app
, and
database
 as soon as you're done with the tutorial, to control costs.
