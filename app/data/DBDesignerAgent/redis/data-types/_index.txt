Redis is a data structure server.
At its core, Redis provides a collection of native data types that help you solve a wide variety of problems, from
caching
 to
queuing
 to
event processing
.
Below is a short description of each data type, with links to broader overviews and command references.

If you'd like to try a comprehensive tutorial for each data structure, see their overview pages below.

Core

Strings

Redis strings
 are the most basic Redis data type, representing a sequence of bytes.
For more information, see:

Overview of Redis strings

Redis string command reference

Lists

Redis lists
 are lists of strings sorted by insertion order.
For more information, see:

Overview of Redis lists

Redis list command reference

Sets

Redis sets
 are unordered collections of unique strings that act like the sets from your favorite programming language (for example,
Java HashSets
,
Python sets
, and so on).
With a Redis set, you can add, remove, and test for existence in O(1) time (in other words, regardless of the number of set elements).
For more information, see:

Overview of Redis sets

Redis set command reference

Hashes

Redis hashes
 are record types modeled as collections of field-value pairs.
As such, Redis hashes resemble
Python dictionaries
,
Java HashMaps
, and
Ruby hashes
.
For more information, see:

Overview of Redis hashes

Redis hashes command reference

Sorted sets

Redis sorted sets
 are collections of unique strings that maintain order by each string's associated score.
For more information, see:

Overview of Redis sorted sets

Redis sorted set command reference

Streams

A
Redis stream
 is a data structure that acts like an append-only log.
Streams help record events in the order they occur and then syndicate them for processing.
For more information, see:

Overview of Redis Streams

Redis Streams command reference

Geospatial indexes

Redis geospatial indexes
 are useful for finding locations within a given geographic radius or bounding box.
For more information, see:

Overview of Redis geospatial indexes

Redis geospatial indexes command reference

Bitmaps

Redis bitmaps
 let you perform bitwise operations on strings.
For more information, see:

Overview of Redis bitmaps

Redis bitmap command reference

Bitfields

Redis bitfields
 efficiently encode multiple counters in a string value.
Bitfields provide atomic get, set, and increment operations and support different overflow policies.
For more information, see:

Overview of Redis bitfields

The
BITFIELD
 command.

HyperLogLog

The
Redis HyperLogLog
 data structures provide probabilistic estimates of the cardinality (i.e., number of elements) of large sets. For more information, see:

Overview of Redis HyperLogLog

Redis HyperLogLog command reference

Extensions

To extend the features provided by the included data types, use one of these options:

Write your own custom
server-side functions in Lua
.

Write your own Redis module using the
modules API
 or check out the
community-supported modules
.

Use
JSON
,
querying
,
time series
, and other capabilities provided by
Redis Stack
.
