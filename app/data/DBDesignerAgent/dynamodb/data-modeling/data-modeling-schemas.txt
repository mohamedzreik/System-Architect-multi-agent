Data modeling schema design packages in DynamoDB

Learn about data modeling schema design packages for DynamoDB,
including use cases, access patterns, and final schema designs for social networks,
gaming profiles, complaint management, recurring payments, device status, and online
shops.

Prerequisites

Before we attempt to design our schema for DynamoDB, we must first gather some
prerequisite data on the use case the schema needs to support. Unlike relational
databases, DynamoDB is sharded by default, meaning that the data will live on multiple
servers behind the scenes so designing for data locality is important. We'll need to put
together the following list for each schema design:

List of entities (ER Diagram)

Estimated volumes and throughput for each entity

Access patterns that need to be supported (queries and writes)

Data retention requirements
