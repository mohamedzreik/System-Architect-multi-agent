Exploitation requires the attacker to find an API endpoint that accesses a URI that's provided by the client. In general, basic SSRF (when the response is returned to the attacker), is easier to exploit than Blind SSRF in which the attacker has no feedback on whether or not the attack was successful.
Modern concepts in application development encourage developers to access URIs provided by the client. Lack of or improper validation of such URIs are common issues. Regular API requests and response analysis will be required to detect the issue. When the response is not returned (Blind SSRF) detecting the vulnerability requires more effort and creativity.
Successful exploitation might lead to internal services enumeration (e.g. port scanning), information disclosure, bypassing firewalls, or other security mechanisms. In some cases, it can lead to DoS or the server being used as a proxy to hide malicious activities.
Is the API Vulnerable?
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaws occur when an API is fetching a remote
resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It enables an attacker to
coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination,
even when protected by a firewall or a VPN.
Modern concepts in application development make SSRF more common and more
dangerous.
More common - the following concepts encourage developers to access an external
resource based on user input: Webhooks, file fetching from URLs, custom SSO,
and URL previews.
More dangerous - Modern technologies like cloud providers, Kubernetes, and
Docker expose management and control channels over HTTP on predictable,
well-known paths. Those channels are an easy target for an SSRF attack.
It is also more challenging to limit outbound traffic from your application,
because of the connected nature of modern applications.
The SSRF risk can not always be completely eliminated. While choosing a
protection mechanism, it is important to consider the business risks and needs.
Example Attack Scenarios
Scenario #1
A social network allows users to upload profile pictures. The user can choose
either to upload the image file from their machine, or provide the URL of the
image. Choosing the second, will trigger the following API call:
POST /api/profile/upload_picture

{
 "picture_url": "http://example.com/profile_pic.jpg"
}
An attacker can send a malicious URL and initiate port scanning within the
internal network using the API Endpoint.
{
 "picture_url": "localhost:8080"
}
Based on the response time, the attacker can figure out whether the port is
open or not.
Scenario #2
A security product generates events when it detects anomalies in the network.
Some teams prefer to review the events in a broader, more generic monitoring
system, such as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management). For this
purpose, the product provides integration with other systems using webhooks.
As part of a creation of a new webhook, a GraphQL mutation is sent with the URL
of the SIEM API.
POST /graphql

[
 {
 "variables": {},
 "query": "mutation {
 createNotificationChannel(input: {
 channelName: \"ch_piney\",
 notificationChannelConfig: {
 customWebhookChannelConfigs: [
 {
 url: \"http://www.siem-system.com/create_new_event\",
 send_test_req: true
 }
 ]
 }
 }){
 channelId
 }
 }"
 }
]
During the creation process, the API back-end sends a test request to the
provided webhook URL, and presents to the user the response.
An attacker can leverage this flow, and make the API request a sensitive
resource, such as an internal cloud metadata service that exposes credentials:
POST /graphql

[
 {
 "variables": {},
 "query": "mutation {
 createNotificationChannel(input: {
 channelName: \"ch_piney\",
 notificationChannelConfig: {
 customWebhookChannelConfigs: [
 {
 url: \"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ec2-default-ssm\",
 send_test_req: true
 }
 ]
 }
 }) {
 channelId
 }
 }
 }
]
Since the application shows the response from the test request, the attacker
can view the credentials of the cloud environment.
How To Prevent
Isolate the resource fetching mechanism in your network: usually these
 features are aimed to retrieve remote resources and not internal ones.
Whenever possible, use allow lists of:
Remote origins users are expected to download resources from (e.g. Google
 Drive, Gravatar, etc.)
URL schemes and ports
Accepted media types for a given functionality
Disable HTTP redirections.
Use a well-tested and maintained URL parser to avoid issues caused by URL
 parsing inconsistencies.
Validate and sanitize all client-supplied input data.
Do not send raw responses to clients.
