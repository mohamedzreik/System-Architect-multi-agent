TL;DR

On December 3, 2025, coordinated disclosures revealed that multiple releases of
React 19
 and
Next.js
 contain a critical flaw in the
React Server Components (RSC) "Flight" protocol
, allowing
unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE)
. The vulnerability originates from
unsafe deserialization
 of attacker-controlled data in server-side RSC payload handling.

Exploitation only requires a
crafted HTTP request
, works reliably in default configurations, and affects not only React/Next.js, but also any framework or bundler embedding the RSC implementation.

Patches are available and should be applied immediately. Systems running unpatched versions are exposed to full server compromise.

Update (Dec 5, 2025):

The original reporter of this vulnerability,
Lachlan Davidson
, published his original PoCs on
GitHub
.

Overview of the component involved

React Server Components (RSC) and the "Flight" protocol

React 19 introduced a mechanism to split UI rendering between the client and the server, serializing component state and server function calls via a special transport format often referred to as the "Flight" protocol.

Affected packages include:

react-server-dom-webpack

react-server-dom-parcel

react-server-dom-turbopack

These packages deserialize incoming RSC payloads to route server-side operations. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the deserialization logic did not adequately enforce structural or type constraints, enabling malicious payloads to alter execution behavior.

Why the default setup was exposed

Most frameworks that adopt RSC—including Next.js App Router—ship with this logic enabled out of the box. This means that a standard Next.js project created via create-next-app, built and deployed with no code modifications…was exploitable under default settings.

Impacted components

Affected React versions

19.0.0

19.1.0

19.1.1

19.2.0

Affected Next.js versions

All stable 15.x

All stable 16.x

Experimental 14.3.0-canary.77 and above

Other tools and frameworks likely affected due to bundling RSC:

Vite RSC plugin

Parcel RSC plugin

React Router RSC preview

RedwoodSDK

Waku

Any package embedding the vulnerable
react-server-dom-*
 modules

Cloud footprint

Research estimates show ~39% of cloud environments scanned had workloads running vulnerable versions of React/Next.js RSC.

How the incident happened

Underlying vulnerability: Unsafe deserialization

At the core, the server-side RSC engine accepts a serialized "Flight" payload describing:

Component boundaries

Server function references

Data streams

The vulnerable implementations trusted the inbound structure too deeply. When malformed but syntactically valid payloads were submitted, the server:

Failed to reject unexpected object shapes or references

Processed attacker-supplied identifiers

Executed privileged JavaScript paths that were never intended to be externally reachable

This leads directly to remote code execution prior to authentication, which is why the CVSS score is 10.0 (critical).

Attack vector

Remote
: No local access or credentials needed

Unauthenticated
: Anyone can attempt exploitation

Single request
: Crafted HTTP request to an RSC endpoint is sufficient

High reliability
: Testing reports nearly 100% reliability under default configs

Why this is particularly dangerous

Most Next.js apps with App Router expose RSC endpoints publicly.

The RCE occurs before any routing logic or auth gates.

Cloud or serverless deployments often place RSC endpoints at the root of their API surfaces.

Detection and scanning recommendations

For code and dependency scanners

Look for:

"react-server-dom-webpack"
 versions
19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0

"react-server-dom-parcel"
 versions
19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0

"react-server-dom-turbopack"
 versions
19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0

Next.js versions listed in the affected section

For runtime / network-level monitoring

Flag:

Requests to RSC routes containing malformed or unexpected RSC Flight frames

High entropy or anomalous tokens in serialized RSC payloads

Sudden increases in server function invocation errors

For cloud posture tools

Search for workloads deploying:

Containers built prior to Dec 3, 2025

React 19 or Next.js 15/16 images not yet patched

Public-facing workloads using App Router or server actions

Vercel-hosted apps benefit from platform-level request filtering, but still require upgrades.

Mitigation guidance

1. Upgrade immediately

React

19.0.0 →
19.0.1

19.1.x →
19.1.2

19.2.0 →
19.2.1

Next.js

Fixed versions:

Canary users → If using 14.3.0-canary.77 or newer, downgrade to stable:

2. Rebuild applications after upgrading

Ensure CI/CD pipelines rebuild Docker images or serverless bundles with the patched dependency graph.

3. Validate third-party frameworks

If using Redwood, Waku, experimental RSC previews, or bundlers, verify:

Updated RSC implementation shipped

No stale lockfiles are pinning vulnerable versions

4. Enable defense-in-depth controls

Runtime sandboxing for server-side JS

Strict routing for RSC endpoints

Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect malformed RSC payloads

Next steps for the community

For maintainers of dependent ecosystems

Audit any custom RSC extensions

Publish updated advisories and patched builds

Consider hardening deserialization schemas with explicit validation

For organizations

Inventory all workloads using React Server Components

Prioritize internet-facing apps

Monitor for suspicious activity leading up to the patch window

Conduct post-patch forensics to ensure no exploitation occurred

Conclusion

This incident underscores a systemic challenge in modern JavaScript ecosystems: highly dynamic serialization mechanisms can become powerful RCE vectors when insufficient validation is applied. Because React Server Components are rapidly becoming foundational across frameworks, the blast radius of this vulnerability is unusually wide.

Patching this incident is straightforward, but delays dramatically increase risk. Organizations should upgrade now, verify dependent frameworks, and continue monitoring for further updates as ecosystem investigations progress.
