RISC-V Payloads

This week brings more RISC-V payloads from community member
bcoles
. One provides a new adapter which allows RISC-V payloads to be converted to commands and delivered as a Metasploit fetch-payload. The second is a classic bind shell, offering the user interactive connectivity to the target host. Both of these go a long way in improving Metasploit's support for RISC-V systems.

Annual Wrap Up

With a new year comes a new annual wrap up. Earlier this week, the Metasploit project
posted the annual wrap up
 covering notable changes from 2025.

New module content (4)

Taiga tribe_gig authenticated unserialize remote code execution

Authors: rootjog and whotwagner

Type: Exploit

Pull request:
#20700
 contributed by
whotwagner

Path: multi/http/taiga_tribe_gig_unserial

AttackerKB reference:
CVE-2025-62368

Description: This adds a new module for authenticated deserialization vulnerability in Taiga.io (CVE-2025-62368). The module sends malicious data to exposed API, which performs unsafe deserialization, leading to remote code execution.

Python Site-Specific Hook Persistence

Author: msutovsky-r7

Type: Exploit

Pull request:
#20692
 contributed by
msutovsky-r7

Path: multi/persistence/python_site_specific_hook

Description: This adds a persistence module which leverages Python's startup mechanism, where some files can be automatically processed during the initialization of the Python interpreter. Someof those files are startup hooks (site-specific, dist-packages). If these files are present in site-specific or dist-packages directories, any lines beginning with import will be executed automatically. This creates a persistence mechanism if an attacker has established access to the target machine with sufficient permissions.

Add Linux RISC-V command payload adapters

Authors: bcoles
[email protected]

Type: Payload (Adapter)

Pull request:
#20734
 contributed by
bcoles

Description: This extends fetch payloads for RISC-V targets.

Linux Command Shell, Bind TCP Inline

Authors: bcoles
[email protected]
 and modexp

Type: Payload (Single)

Pull request:
#20733
 contributed by
bcoles

Path: linux/riscv32le/shell_bind_tcp

Description: This adds a new payload: a bind shell for Linux RISC-V targets.

Bugs fixed (2)

#20370
 from
msutovsky-r7
 - Fixes an issue that occurred when negotiating the SMB version and the server uses an unknown dialect. Now, the login function will throw an exception and exit gracefully.

#20744
 from
ptrstr
 - This fixes a bug in unix/webapp/wp_reflexgallery_file_upload where the current year and month were being hardcoded in the request. This caused the server to reject the exploit if there was no folder in wp-content/uploads for that specific year and month. Now the year and month are configurable datastore options.

Documentation added (1)

#20831
 from
DataExplorerX
 - This adds link to issues in Metasploit Framework Github repository.
