Overview

On December 17, 2025, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) published an
advisory
 for
CVE-2025-37164
, a CVSS 10.0 vulnerability in
HPE OneView
. The vulnerability, which was reported to HPE by security researcher Nguyen Quoc Khanh, facilitates unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on versions of HPE OneView before 11.0. Defenders are advised to prioritize upgrading to version 11.0 or applying the emergency hotfixes (
HPE OneView virtual appliance hotfix
,
HPE Synergy hotfix
) as soon as possible.

OneView sits at a
privileged control plane
 for enterprise infrastructure, so successful exploitation isn't just about establishing remote code execution, it's about gaining centralized control over servers, firmware, and lifecycle management at scale. The real concern here is exposure and trust assumptions. Management platforms are often deployed deep inside the network with broad privileges and minimal monitoring because they're 'supposed' to be trusted. When an unauthenticated RCE shows up in that layer, defenders need to treat it as an assumed-breach scenario, prioritize patching immediately, and review access paths and segmentation.

Update #1: A Rapid7 technical analysis of CVE-2025-37164 has been

published

on AttackerKB, and a Metasploit module is

now available
.

Update #2: On January 7, 2026, CVE-2025-37164 was added to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) list of
known exploited vulnerabilities
 (KEV), based on evidence of active exploitation.

Hotfix analysis

Rapid7 Labs has begun an initial analysis of the vendor-supplied hotfix HPE_OneView_CVE_37164_Z7550-98077.bin. This hotfix applies a new HTTP rule to the appliance's webserver to block access to a specific REST API endpoint. This endpoint is /rest/id-pools/executeCommand. Initial inspection of the appliance code indicates this endpoint is reachable without authentication. Rapid7 Labs assesses with a high degree of confidence that this is the access vector for triggering the vulnerability and achieving remote code execution.

Mitigation guidance

According to HPE
, CVE-2025-37164 affects HPE OneView versions below 11.0, version 5.20 through version 10.20, unless a security hotfix (
HPE OneView virtual appliance hotfix
,
HPE Synergy hotfix
) has been applied.

For the latest mitigation guidance for HPE OneView, please refer to the vendor's
security advisory
