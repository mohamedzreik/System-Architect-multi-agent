The Code Review Patch challenges are designed to enhance your ability to identify vulnerabilities in code. In these challenges, you are provided with both the vulnerable code and the corresponding patch. Your initial task is to try to identify the issue in the vulnerable code without referring to the patch. This approach helps sharpen your analytical skills and deepens your understanding of common vulnerabilities.

If you are unable to find the issue or wish to verify your findings, you can refer to the patch (the diff file). This step is crucial as it not only confirms the presence of the vulnerability but also educates you on the correct way to address it. These challenges are particularly useful for improving your skills in code review and understanding the nuances of secure coding practices.
