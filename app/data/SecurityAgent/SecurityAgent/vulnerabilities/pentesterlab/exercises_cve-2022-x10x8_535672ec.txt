Golang Code Review Badge

The Code Review Patch challenges are designed to enhance your skills in identifying vulnerabilities by reviewing code. You will be given both the vulnerable code and its corresponding patch. The primary objective is to spot the issue in the code on your own. However, if you struggle to find the vulnerability or wish to verify your findings, you can refer to the provided patch (the diff file) for confirmation. This approach not only helps in identifying the issues but also in understanding how patches are applied to fix them.

In this specific challenge, you will analyze the file
templates/repo/issue/list.tmpl
 and review the changes made in the patch
cve-2022-x10x8.diff
. The patch highlights a critical fix where user-provided data was improperly handled, leading to potential security issues. By examining the patch, you will understand the importance of sanitizing user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This exercise will reinforce best practices in secure coding and code review processes.
