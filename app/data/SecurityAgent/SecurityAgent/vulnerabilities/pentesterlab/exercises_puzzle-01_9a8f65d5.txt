This lab presents a puzzle designed to help you trigger a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The key to solving this challenge lies in understanding how the Ruby method
String#gsub
 operates, especially concerning backreferences when a match is found.

To begin, explore the method
String#gsub
 and pay special attention to backreferences. Examples provided, like
"hello".gsub(/l+/, "\0")
 and
"hello".gsub(/l+/, "\&")
, will be particularly useful. Ensure that you fully grasp why the payload you discover works, as this understanding is crucial for mastering XSS vulnerabilities.
