IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale (IMDG)

IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale is IBMs in memory data grid product (IMDG). It can be used as a key-value store which partitions the keys (using a form of consistent hashing) over a set of servers such that each server is responsible for a subset of the keys. It automatically handles

Ringo - Distributed key-value storage for immutable data

Ringo is an experimental, distributed, replicating key-value store based on consistent hashing and immutable data. Unlike many general-purpose databases, Ringo is designed for a specific use case: For archiving small (less than 4KB) or medium-size data items (<100MB) in real-time so that the data can survive K - 1

Paper: Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web

Consistent hashing is one of those ideas that really puts the science in computer science and reminds us why all those really smart people spend years slaving over algorithms. Consistent hashing is "a scheme that provides hash table functionality in a way that the addition or removal of one
