AI-Assisted Development: Real World Patterns, Pitfalls, and Production Readiness

AI is no longer a research experiment or a novelty: it is part of the software delivery pipeline. Teams are learning that integrating AI into production is less about model performance and more about architecture, process, and accountability. In this issue on AI-Assisted Development, we examine what happens after the proof of concept and how AI changes the way we build, and operate systems.

Cell-Based Architectures: How to Build Scalable and Resilient Systems

Cell-based architecture is a resiliency and fault tolerance pattern that has co-evolved with SOA and microservices. It builds on the bulkhead pattern to limit the blast radius in case of failures. The cell-based approach can also help organize large-scale microservice architectures into domain-bound service groups to promote high cohesion and loose coupling and help organizations scale.
