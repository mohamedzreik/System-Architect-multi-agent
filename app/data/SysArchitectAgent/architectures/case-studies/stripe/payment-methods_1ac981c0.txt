Case studies

Amazon simplifies cross-border payments with Stripe

Amazon set out to build a payments infrastructure that not only delivers an innovative and personalized checkout experience, but also a set of payments services that power Amazon's portfolio of products and businesses around the world.

Challenge

As Amazon expanded into new geographies, it sought to bring a new level of simplicity to international payments.

Solution

Amazon partnered with Stripe to streamline global payments experiences, particularly as the company looked to launch in new countries quickly. For example, when Amazon expanded into Poland, the team worked with Stripe to optimize the checkout experience with BLIK, a popular local payment method in the region.

WooCommerce partners with Stripe to launch in 17 new countries in 3 months

WooCommerce is one of the most popular ecommerce platforms in the world, enabling WordPress businesses to sell and manage orders directly from their websites.

Challenge

WooCommerce already had a longtime partnership with Stripe for core payment processing capabilities, but realized it could further leverage Stripe to empower its merchants to offer local payment methods.

Solution

WooCommerce set out to expand its platform offering to match the rapidly evolving needs of its merchants. To do this, it decided to launch a brand new platform, WooCommerce Payments, by integrating several different Stripe products—including Connect, Instant Payouts, Terminal, and Billing.

Solution

By offering more flexible ways to pay with Klarna at checkout, INDOCHINO saw a lift in sales volume across the board and a 16% lift in its AOV. Of INDOCHINO customers using Klarna, 67% are young Millennials and Gen Zers—the key demographic the brand was aiming to target.

Bodum is a kitchenware manufacturer producing high-quality coffee and tea solutions and household accessories. It creates functional designs at affordable prices with a strong focus on sustainability and environmental responsibility.

Challenge

With the majority of customers ordering from a mobile device, Bodum was looking to build a seamless online customer experience for both desktop and mobile.

Solution

Bodum localized its checkout experience to scale its online business to 23 countries across Europe, America, Australia, and Asia. Implementing Stripe Elements took less than a month initially, and Bodum can now turn on any new payment methods that become available, directly from the Dashboard with no additional engineering required.

Mobile checkout is the future, but the distraction rate is very high. If a customer is buying something through a mobile site and they get another notification, the risk of losing that purchase is high. Local payment methods are really important to help customers complete their purchase as quickly as possible.
