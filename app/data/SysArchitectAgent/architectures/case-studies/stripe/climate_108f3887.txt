The case for funding carbon removal

Carbon removal is critical to counteract climate change

To prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we should aim to limit global average temperature increase to
1.5°C
 above pre-industrial levels, which corresponds to reducing global annual CO₂ emissions from about
40 gigatons per year
 as of 2018, to net zero by 2050.

To accomplish this, the world will likely need to both radically reduce the new emissions we put into the air, and
remove carbon
 already in the atmosphere.

Path to limit global temperature increase to ~1.5°C

Historical emissions via Global Carbon Project,1 "Current path" shows SSP4-6.0,2,3 removal pathways adapted from CICERO.4 For simplicity this chart only shows CO₂, though the modeled scenarios account for other greenhouse gas emissions, all of which will need to be reduced.

However, carbon removal is behind

Existing carbon removal solutions such as reforestation and soil carbon sequestration are important, but they alone are unlikely to scale to the
size of the problem
. New carbon removal technologies need to be developed—ones that have the potential to be high volume and low cost by 2050—even if they aren't yet mature.

Today, carbon removal solutions face a chicken-and-egg problem. As early technologies, they're more expensive, so don't attract a critical mass of customers. But without wider adoption, they can't scale production to
become cheaper
.

Early adopters can change the course of carbon removal

Early purchasers can help new carbon removal technologies get down the cost curve and up the volume curve. Experience with manufacturing learning and experience curves has shown repeatedly that deployment and scale beget improvement, a
phenomenon
 seen across DNA sequencing, hard drive capacity, and solar panels.

This thinking shaped Stripe's initial purchases and ultimately led us to
launch Frontier
, an advance market commitment (AMC) to buy carbon removal. The goal is to send a strong demand signal to researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors that there is a growing market for these technologies. We're optimistic that we can shift the trajectory of the industry and increase the likelihood the world has the portfolio of solutions needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

 uses ceramic monolith air contactors to capture CO₂ directly from the air for permanent storage underground. Their direct air capture system, powered by carbon-free electricity and built with modular components, is designed for quick manufacturing and capture at scale.

UNDO
 spreads crushed basalt rock on agricultural land, accelerating the natural process of rock weathering. CO₂ dissolved in rainwater reacts with the rock, mineralizes and is safely stored on geologic timescales as bicarbonate. The team is conducting lab and field trials to further the evidence of enhanced rock weathering as a permanent, scalable, nature-enabled technology for carbon removal.

Arbon
 uses a 'humidity-swing' process to capture CO₂ from the air. The sorbent binds CO₂ when dry and releases it when wet. This process uses less energy than approaches that rely on changing temperature and pressure to release CO₂. The sorbent's ability to bind CO₂ has been shown to remain stable over thousands of cycles. Both of these innovations could reduce the cost of DAC.

Vycarb
 uses a reactor to add limestone alkalinity to coastal ocean water, resulting in the drawdown and storage of atmospheric CO₂. Their dissolution system has a novel sensing apparatus that base tests water, dissolves calcium carbonate, and doses alkalinity into the water at a controlled amount safe for dispersion. Their closed system makes it easier to measure the amount of dissolved alkalinity added and CO₂ removed.
