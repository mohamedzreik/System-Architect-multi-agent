A Charter
for a Better Place to
Play  Chill Together

Created with teens, for teens.

This may come as a surprise,

but the person writing these words is not a teen.

So while we're not experts in what it feels like to be a teen right now, we are experts in building digital spaces where you and your friends can play and chill.

And because you're great at knowing what it's like to be you, a teen, we have worked closely with teen users globally (30+ focus groups!) to understand what matters most to make your experiences safe.

Teen Charter

This set of principles represent the expectations teens have of each other and of Discord. Whether you're new to Discord or a long time user, this charter is key to keep in mind and hold each other and us accountable to - so everyone can have a safe experience. These principles will help inform product and policy improvements that make Discord a better place to play and chill.

Come as you are

Authenticity

What's yours is yours

Privacy

Take space, make space

Inclusivity

Know the Discord deets

Transparency

Come as you are

Authenticity

On Discord, you should feel empowered to share the version of yourself that you feel most comfortable being. All teens have the right to find community and to engage in safe spaces as themselves.

Take space, make space

Inclusivity

Teens should feel that they can express their thoughts and opinions and support other teens to do the same. On Discord, you should be able to express yourself freely as long as it doesn't end up harming someone else.

What's yours is yours

Privacy

We believe you should be in control of how much personal information you share on Discord. Teens also have a responsibility to protect each other's information too; this may look like asking before sharing someone else's information.

Know the Discord deets

Transparency

We want you to have a clear understanding of how Discordcollects, and uses, and protects your information, how
content moderation
 decisions are made, and
how youraccount status can be impacted
. It's on us to make sure you continually feel like you know what's going on.

IT TAKES A VILLAGE

We agree with teens that it's first and foremost our responsibility to create positive experiences on Discord, which is why we provide tools that build in checkpoints like our
Teen Safety Assist initiative
.

Server moderators and administrators also have a unique vantage point and use tools to help maintain a healthy environment. When you don't have to think about protecting yourself, then we're doing our job.

We heard from teens that some of you have developed skills to make an assessment and take action to keep yourself safe. Know that you don't have to do it alone - we have your back and
work endlessly to keep you safe while protecting your privacy.
