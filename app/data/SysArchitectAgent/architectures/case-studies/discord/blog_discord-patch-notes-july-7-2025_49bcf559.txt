Welcome to Patch Notes! In this series, we comb through the newest changes in performance, reliability, responsiveness, usability, and general bug-squishing we've done to make Discord better.

If you discover a bug of your own, check out our
Bimonthly Bug Megathread
 on the community-run r/DiscordApp subreddit. Tell us what's been bothering you, and our Engineering team will be more than happy to check it out.

Those who love living on the edge can opt into the TestFlight version of Discord and try out the latest features before they release on iOS. Help us squish some pesky bugs! It's like your uncle works at Discord. Find it at

All fixes listed below have been committed and merged, but may still be rolling out to individual platforms at the time of this post.
