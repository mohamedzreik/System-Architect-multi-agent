"

Adding the Discord Social SDK to Predecessor has been a huge win for both our players and the business. When Discord first walked us through what the SDK could do, it was an easy yes. It solved a bunch of things we were missing like built-in voice and text chat and gave us a chance to offer something our players already love and use daily, right inside our game

Robbie Singh

CEO, Omeda Studios

"

Pax Dei is at heart a social sandbox. Our collaboration to put Discord at the heart of our MMO makes that deep social vision a reality, offering a world where you can find your friends and deepen those connections both in and outside our game.

Thor Gunnarsson

Co-founder & CEO, Mainframe Industries

"

The Discord Social SDK has added a dimension to communication in Rust. Players often rely on communication and we're seeing a growing number of friends teaming up and getting together to play as squads.

Ashley Cook

Marketing Manager, Facepunch Studios

The Discord SDK makes social features like direct messaging, lobbies, and session invites easy. Provisional accounts help us deliver this value to all of our players.

Questions?

General Product

What are the costs associated with using Discord Social SDK?

The Discord Social SDK is currently available to download from our Developer Portal at no cost.

Which platforms are supported by the Discord Social SDK?

The Discord Social SDK is compatible with both Unreal Engine and Unity. It is available for production for PC, with mobile (iOS and Android), as well as console support for PlayStation and Xbox available for experimental use. The Discord Social SDK does not formally support HTML5/Web or Linux platforms. Read more about platform support in our
documentation
.

Can we use Discord Voice Chat without the full SDK integration?

No. Discord Voice Chat is not available as a standalone service.

Can I customize how my invites and rich presence look in Discord?

Yes! The Social SDK provides a variety of configuration options to tailor how rich presence and invites show up to players within Discord. See the
Setting Rich Presence
 and
Managing Game Invites
 guides to see how it's done.

Player Experience

If I implement this SDK, will players need a Discord account to play my game?

Players will not be required to connect a Discord account to play your game. However, for players to take full advantage of the Discord Social SDK features, players will need to connect a Discord account. Non-Discord users will have more limited access.

Will this integration affect my game performance?

The Discord Social SDK is written in performant C++ to be as fast as possible. It offloads all work to a separate thread as the game, while loading and processing data that is relevant to minimize cost. Additionally, the voice engine is already in use within the Discord client, known for stability and quality.

Are players required to use the in-game features that enable them to send/receive Discord messages and view their Discord friends from within a game?

No, the social features that enable players to send/receive Discord messages and view their Discord friends from within a game are optional. Players will choose whether or not to connect their Discord account to enable them.

If a player is messaging a friend on Discord, how can the friend on Discord know that they're receiving messages from within a game?

When a player has sent a message from within a game, a controller icon will appear next to their name on Discord as a visual indicator.

Security and Privacy

Who is responsible for moderation? If issues happen through a Discord DM that shows in-game, is it our job to moderate or Discord's?

Developers are responsible for moderation of all messages or other content within their game. See
Moderation with the Discord Social SDK
 for more information.

What will Discord do with player messages from the game that appear in Discord?

Messages sent from the game that appear on Discord are treated like any other message on Discord, consistent with Discord's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can also find more information here. If you have further questions, please reach out to Discord directly.

Can we create provisional accounts programmatically without requiring user credentials or manual input?

Yes, you will be able to create provisional accounts programmatically for every player, without the need for user credentials or manual input. These accounts are not visible to players and are replaced by linked accounts once the player connects their Discord account. This functionality is a core requirement of the SDK, as provisional accounts enable full SDK capabilities for both linked and unlinked players.

What kind of user authentication is used?

The Discord Social SDK operates under normal OAuth2 principles.

Are provisional accounts full Discord accounts that players can interact with?

Provisional accounts are accounts that can be used to access SDK features in a game, but they cannot be used to log into the Discord client. They allow a player to have access to in-game functionality powered by the SDK such as game invites, friends list, DMs, lobby chat, even if they don't have a Discord account or haven't linked their Discord account. However, because the player can't log into a provisional account using the Discord app, they cannot do the following:

Receive DMs from players when they aren't playing

Respond to messages when they aren't playing

See friends status when they aren't playing

Access a unified friends list between different games
