QUESTS NOOB GUIDE

The ins and outs to our Ads and everything in between.

What are Discord Quests?

Quests are our new ad format designed to engage players on Discord. Players can earn rewards like in-game items or Discord avatar decorations by completing Quest requirements, which may include watching a video, playing or streaming a game on Discord for a specific amount of time.

With Quests, players can discover exciting new games and content, and get rewarded for engaging.

Where do Quests show up?

Quests appear natively across Discord on multiple surfaces. Most users will find Quests through the Quest Bar, which appears at the top of the user activity console or at the bottom of the mobile app. Quests also appear in social activity panels if a friend is participating in a Quest. Finally, all ongoing Quests can be found in the Quests tab, located in the top right corner of the desktop application.

Where are Quests available?

Quests can be launched in all regions where Discord is available around the world. You can tailor your audience to specific countries based on your campaign goals.

What Quest formats are there?

We currently have 2 Quests formats:

Video Quests
: Users must watch a video in order to unlock a reward. Video Quests are 100% viewable, and are ideal for trailers, a new season launch, product video, or anything in-between.

Play Quests
: Designed to get players back into your game, or playing for the first time. We'll show your ad to former and prospective players, and they'll be rewarded for playing.

What are the Quest rewards?

Quest rewards are incentives given to Discord players upon completing a Quest. These rewards can include valuable in-game items or items from the Discord Shop, such as Avatar Decorations. Our Sales team will advise advertisers on the most effective type of reward for their campaign goals.

Where can I see active Quests?

All active Quests can be found on the Quest Home (Discover > Quests).

How much do Quests cost?

Our Sales team can discuss Quest campaign costs with you, and the price will depend on variables like campaign reach, geographies, and more. You can get in touch with our team by completing
this form
.

Can non-gaming brands run Discord Quests?

At the moment, we're focusing on customers in the Gaming and Media & Entertainment industries.
 to stay informed as we evolve and expand our offerings to more industries and companies.
