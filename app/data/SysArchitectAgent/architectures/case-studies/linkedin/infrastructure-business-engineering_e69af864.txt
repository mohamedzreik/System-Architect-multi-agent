Infrastructure Business Engineering (IBE)

IBE brings the infrastructure closer to engineering teams per requirement and transforms the engineering projects to accounting language thereby taking away the financial worries from engineers.

We support the IT (enterprise) as well as DC (production) requirements and work with engineers to understand their project needs, plan capacity, prepare demand forecasting, plan budgets and manage, spend, source and negotiate from the best in the industry to procure and maintain the asset through its life cycle. Finally, we decommission and dispose of the assets while managing every step according to legal policies and applying accounting principles.

With a vision to build, manage and scale business processes to provide infrastructure consistently and reliability to our customers, our mission is to supply infrastructure that powers the economic graph and employee productivity through insights and process efficiency.

Our goal is to build scalable org and systems to deliver infrastructure with flexibility and operational efficiency.
