Background

A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is a document that outlines how well a product aligns with accessibility (a11y) standards. Its primary purpose is to inform customers about a product's a11y features, enabling them to make informed decisions before purchasing software.

At Slack, we conducted a VPAT by a third party a11y vendor in 2024 following our significant UI change (
IA4
). During this VPAT process, we identified a11y issues across Android, iOS, and desktop. Of the issues identified on Android, we immediately assigned the obvious shovel-ready issues, such as those with color contrast and missing image labels, to the responsible teams for resolution.

To address remaining Android issues, we conducted a comprehensive triage process. In this document, we take a look at the major recurring themes of Android accessibility issues and share resolution strategies and lessons learned in the hopes of helping others make similar improvements.

Identified themes

[Note: ✅ for resolved and ⏳ for future work.]

✅ P1: Error messages are inaccessible

✅ P2: Headings are not identified

✅ P2: Missing a11y label on EditField

✅ P2: Incorrect number of items in list

✅ P2: Drag and drop in the workspace switcher is inaccessible

✅ P2: Strikethrough information not conveyed to screen reader users

✅ P3: Errors indicated by color alone

⏳ P3: Keyboard Navigation and Focus

Keyboard navigability can help customers with motor and visual impairments use Slack on Android. It's more commonly used on larger form factors (e.g. tablets). We received numerous VPAT tickets related to the keyboard navigation, however, Slack on Android currently does not yet support the large form factor. As a result, we have decided to explore other solutions that align with recommended practices and standards.

Issue resolution

P1: Error messages are inaccessible.

Report

If the user enters an invalid input to an edit field and presses "Next" (or Submit), an error message is displayed, but
the error is not communicated to users using screen readers
. TalkBack should announce that it is in an error state when it receives focus, along with the error message so that users understand why it's in error.

Resolution

On Android, errors can be displayed to users in two primary ways:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| (1) Immediately below the editing field. Error is displayed right below an image edit field. | (2) Via the SK error banner. Error is shown via SKBanner error type. |

In both cases, TalkBack did not announce errors, so users must swipe through the screen to determine what occurred. For case (1), we modified
OutlinedTextField
 so that the error is announced immediately below the editing field. For case (2),
SKBanner
 for the error type was updated so that when an error occurs, the error is announced to screen reader users. The videos below illustrate the changes before and after using TalkBack for case (2).

P1: Heading is not identified.

Report

The heading does not convey clear semantic information, making it difficult for screen reader users to quickly grasp the page's structure and navigate efficiently. Defining headings enables assistive technology to convey the hierarchical organization of the content, enhancing accessibility and providing an alternative navigation method.

Resolution

We identified and fixed issues with missing headings inside lists (such as in the Preferences page).

The vendor also suggested that titles in the top app bar should also be a heading, but we found that this pattern is not consistent with Android standards after testing other apps. Therefore, we closed those tickets.

P2: Missing a11y label on EditField

Report

Some edit fields do not have permanent labels. It is labeled using placeholder text that is removed when the user enters text.
Some users with cognitive difficulties may forget the purpose of the edit field without a permanently visible label.

Resolution

During our recent bug fixes, we encountered a few tricky cases that required collaboration with our design team and screen reader users. Specifically, we focused on our main search field and message input area (AMI). For AMI, space constraints prevented us from implementing an optimal solution. However, for the search field, we opted for a simple yet impactful change by adding an explicit search icon. This minor modification helps users easily identify the purpose of the edit field, significantly enhancing their overall experience.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Before Previously, there is no visual indictor in a search input field other than a placeholder text. When a user enters a text, it's not obvious what this field is. | After  We added a magnifying glass icon to the input field. When a user enters a text, it's clear that the edit field is for search. |

P2: Incorrect number of items in list

Report

When TalkBack users have
Always speak number of list items
 setting enabled and navigate through a list, TalkBack announces an incorrect number of items.

Resolution

Our vintage Slack Kit (SK) Bottom sheet was the primary source of the issue. SK divider, although purely decorative, was considered an item within a list. For example, if the bottom sheet had 7 row items, including 2 divider items, TalkBack would announce "7 items in a list" instead of the intended "5 items in a list".

To resolve this, we introduced a new
SKListAccessibilityDelegate
 for
SKListAdapter
, overwriting the a11y
CollectionInfo
 with the correct number of items.

P2: Drag and drop in the workspace switcher is inaccessible.

Report

Workspaces in the workspace switcher can be rearranged, but it requires the user to select a workspace and drag it to the new location. People who lack the dexterity required to perform this action may have difficulties completing the task, or may not be able to complete the task at all.

Resolution

In discussions with the design team, we decided to implement an
Edit
 mode in the workspace switcher. When a user enters Edit mode, a six-dot drag handle is displayed for each workspace row so users know that each workspace row has a drag-and-drop capability.

Additionally, we introduced custom actions (Move before and after) for TalkBack users so users can move each row item from the TalkBack context menu by three-finger tap on a row item or
L
 or
r
 drawing gestures.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Before Before: there is no indication from UI that each workspace is draggable to move around. | After After: Upon entering Edit mode, each row in the workspace is equipped with a six-dot drag handle. Once the user has completed rearranging the workspaces, they can click the "Done" button located in the top right corner, causing the six-dot drag handles to disappear. |

P2: Strikethrough information not conveyed to screen reader users

Report

Users have the option to format text as strikethrough, but the strikethrough information is not conveyed to screen reader users. It is visually evident that the text has strikethrough, but it is read as normal text for screen reader users.

Resolution

During our conversation, we made a decision in consultation with a member of the blind community and agreed that the strikethrough format did not pose an issue.
Most screen readers don't interpret this format
 because doing so making it verbose and potentially confusing for screen reader users. They may interpret this strikethrough announcement as being part of the message itself.

As a general best practice,
it's recommended to avoid strikethrough format for accessibility reasons
. Additionally, some sighted users may find it challenging to read.

P3: Errors indicated by color alone

Report

If the user enters an invalid input to an edit field, an error message is displayed below the edit field. The only indication it is an error is that it is written with red text.
To users unable to perceive red text
, the error text is just another message on the screen and not necessarily an error.

Resolution

We recently updated the design for displaying errors in edit fields, but there seems to be some inconsistency in its implementation. To address this, we conducted an audit of our usage and updated several screens accordingly. While it's a relatively minor change, it improves the intuitiveness of understanding error messages.

| --- | --- |
| Before Error text with red color is shown below an edit field. | After Error text with red color and an error icon are shown below an edit field. |

Conclusion

Through the process of triaging and addressing VPAT issues, we have gained valuable insights.

One crucial lesson learned is the importance of immediately announcing errors to screen reader users. This eliminates the need for them to navigate through screens to understand the outcome of their actions.

We discovered that seemingly minor UI changes, such as adding visual icons to text, can have a significant impact on our user's experience.

Furthermore, we recognized the need to be more diligent in adding TalkBack custom actions for gestures that may not be easily discoverable, like drag-and-drop or swipe-to-dismiss.

Collaborating with our a11y-minded design team greatly facilitated the decision-making process and issue resolution.

Although not all Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards can be directly applied to Android, the industry has long endeavored to establish platform-specific guidelines for mobile native apps. However, significant progress has yet to be made. Our VPAT analysis revealed that certain accessibility issues are not applicable to Android's native patterns. To gain a deeper understanding, we dedicated time to testing native Google apps and discussing our decisions regarding the applicability of WCAG standards to Android.

While the timing of our next VPAT assessment is yet to be determined, we are committed to continuously evaluating and improving the accessibility of Slack across all platforms. We hope you have gained valuable insights from this article.
