How We Built Meta Ray-Ban Display: From Zero to Polish

By
Pascal Hartig

We're going behind the scenes of the
Meta Ray-Ban Display
, Meta's most advanced AI glasses yet. In a previous episode we met the team behind the Meta Neural Band, the EMG wristband packaged with the Ray-Ban Display. Now we're delving into the glasses themselves.

Kenan and Emanuel, from Meta's Wearables org, join
Pascal Hartig
 on the Meta Tech Podcast to talk about all the unique challenges of designing game-changing wearable technology, from the unique display technology to emerging UI patterns for display glasses.

You'll also learn what particle physics and hardware design have in common and how to celebrate even the incremental wins in a fast-moving culture.
