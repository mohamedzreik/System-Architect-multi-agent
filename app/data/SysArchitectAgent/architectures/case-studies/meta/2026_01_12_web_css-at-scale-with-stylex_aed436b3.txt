Build a large enough website with a large enough codebase, and you'll eventually find that CSS presents challenges at scale. It's no different at Meta, which is why we open-sourced StyleX, a solution for CSS at scale. StyleX combines the ergonomics of CSS-in-JS with the performance of static CSS. It allows atomic styling of components while deduplicating definitions to reduce bundle size and exposes a simple API for developers.

StyleX has become the standard at companies like Figma and Snowflake. Here at Meta,
it's the standard styling system
 across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads.

On this episode of the Meta Tech Podcast, meet Melissa, a software engineer at Meta and one of StyleX's maintainers.
Pascal Hartig
 talks to her about all things StyleX—its origins, how open source has been a force multiplier for the project, and what it's like interacting with large companies across the industry as they've adopted StyleX.
